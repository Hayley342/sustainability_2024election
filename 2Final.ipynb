        "# Impacts of the 2024 Election on Sustainability and ESG Discourse\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction:\n",
        "\n",
        "Over the past decade, frameworks for evaluating a company's operations, impact and ethical performance beyond traditional financial metrics have become more prominent. Particularly as climate change mitigation  has become a priority for some consumers, investors and nations, more emphasis has been placed not only on the short term financial returns of a businness but also the long run sustainability of industries and society more broadly. These topics are often referenced as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Sustainability metrics to demonstrate private sector accountability and future-focused resiliency taking into account both environmental harm and societal well-being. However, in the United States, there has been significant backlash, particularly from the Right, and it is difficult to know what role ESG and Sustainability will play in business practices moving forward. Some claim that ESG is \"dead\", while others believe it has become more important than ever.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the wake of the 2024 national elections in the United States, this conversation has become even more complex. With the election of Donald Trump and Republican control of the legislature, conservative politics will prevail at the national level over the next 2 (if not 4) years. It is difficult to know at this juncture how this scenario will play out for ESG and Sustainability efforts and it will be important to assess the conversational shifts around these topics to predict how markets, investors and corporate actors will respond. Private sector actors are influenced by and at times beholden to elected officials and the Republican party has shown itself to be somewhere between apathy and downright hostility when it comes to ESG and Sustainability matters. This is why I have chosen to conduct this research to analyze the immediate response to the 2024 national elections in relation to ESG and Sustainability. For this project I endeavor to answer the question: Has the election shifted the way newspapers discuss ESG and Sustainability and, if so, in what ways? I am interested in addressing this particular topic because businness practices and investments have major implications for social and ecological outcomes. Moving towards more stringent ESG requirements and public pressure on the private sector to consider sustainability as an important factor in their decision making could enhance climate change mitigation and improve societal wellbeing. Conversely, moving away from these efforts could have the opposite effect. Additionally, the narratives espoused by large media houses are helpful in understanding where we are (and where we are going) in the ESG and Sustainability space. This is because news media has the power to shape public opinion on these issues, but is simultaneously reflective of public, corporate and political sentiment. News is both an influencer of and influenced by public opinion and therefore offers a pulse-check of more general trends in national perspective shifts. I predict that the election of Donald Trump and Republican control of the legislature has shifted conversations around sustainability and that the direction and magnitude of these shifts are dependent on where a news source lies on the ideological spectrum.\n",

        "## Methodology\n",
        "The code for this project was adapted from Rebecca Krisel's Python coursework material; [Introduction to NLTK](https://github.com/rskrisel/intro_to_nltk/blob/main/Intro_NLTK_workshop.ipynb), [Collecting news data from Factiva](https://github.com/rskrisel/factiva_dataframe/blob/main/Create_spreadsheet_Factiva_data.ipynb) and [Sentiment Analysis Workshop](https://github.com/rskrisel/sentiment_analysis_workshop/blob/main/sentiment_analysis.ipynb). The full code for this project is included below, after the Conclusion section.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Collection\n",
        "For this research I utilized html data from the Factiva database to analyze text from news articles. First, I selected 3 news sources to pull articles from; The New York Times, Reuters and The Wall Street Journal. These sources are left-leaning, center and right-leaning (respectively) according to AllSides, an organization that provides data on media bias. I chose to select sources representing different views along the political spectrum in order to compare their reactions to the election results. Additionally, I chose sources with high readership and avoided more fringe sources to represent perspectives shared with a wider swath of American readers. Moreover, these newspapers have a dedicated section or focus on businness and economics which is the area of impact I am most interested in.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, I selected the parameters for my search and extraction of articles. I chose the keywords \"ESG\", \"sustainability\", \"Inflation Reduction Act\", \"climate change\", \"decarbonization\", \"sustainable investing\", \"sustainable finance\", \"clean energy\", \"renewable energy\", \"green energy\" and \"climate policy\" after consulting ChatGPT to locate words and phrases most commonly associated with ESG and Sustainability in businness. After reviewing the output, I added \"not 'Medicare'\" as I had noticed the Inflation Reduction Act had elicited several articles referencing Medicare which is unrelated to my research question. Additionally, I chose to limit articles to those that contained my keywords within the headline in order to ensure that the articles I would analyze are primarily focused on these topics and avoid including articles that simply mention these topics. Furthermore, I limited articles to those in the United States to maintain a focus on the response from the American perspective and those written in English to ensure the text could be analyzed with tools developed for English language processing. I created two datasets, one including all articles between the dates September 1st and November 4th and the second to capture articles between November 6th and December 10th. This way I could assess whether a narrative shift had occurred in the immediate aftermath of the election by comparing the outcomes of several analyses across the two datasets.\n",

Cleaning at this stage included lemmatization to simplify words to their root form, removing punctuation, changing all words to lowercase, removing common words (stopwords) and tokenizing words. This process reduced the text of the articles to more manageable data for analysis and avoided analysis of information that is irrelevant to the study (e.g. we don't want to analyze words like \"and\" and \"the\" or differentiate between \"sustainable\" and \"Sustainability\")."

        "Reuters and the New York Times saw a drop in positivity for headlines related to ESG and Sustainability of about the same degree (-0.07) whereas the Wall Street Journal had an increase in positive sentiment of about 0.08. The overall change in sentiment for all three sources stayed almost exactly the same dropping by only 0.001. This outcome is not particularly surprising; conservative media is feeling more positive after national elections that went strongly in favor of Republicans and left-leaning reporting is conveying a more pessimistic tone. However, it is notable that Reuters, a centrist source considered to be relatively unbiased, showed the largest decrease in positivity among the articles sampled. This could imply that projections about the future of sustainability and ESG were more negative in the weeks following the elections. Given that centrist journalism is less vulnerable to partisan panic after an election loss, this may be a more credible indicator of expectations for the future of ESG and Sustainability under a Republican government. More investigation would be required to determine whether this negative shift was indeed a result of the election outcomes by controlling for other events during this time frame that may have led to a more negative sentiment around these issues. Moreover, in all of these cases it is difficult to say if sentiment is directed towards ESG and Sustainability as a concept or if levels of negativity and positivity are related to the future projections regarding the aims of these movements. For example, a headline may be negative about ESG in the sense that the author disagrees with people who are in favor of ESG or, conversely, a headline may be negative about ESG because they believe the goals of climate mitigation and social wellbeing are not being met. This is one obstacle in evaluating sentiment pertaining to particular topics, making it difficult to separate out whether an article is gloomy because ESG is being discarded or because the writer is antagonistic towards ESG efforts.\n",

        "For the similar words analysis looking at words related to ESG, Sustainability and Climate the results were somewhat inconclusive. Some words identified were not particularly relevant and reflected current events for the time frame such as \"york\" and \"wildfire\" which likely referenced wildfires that were spreading across the Northeast at the time. However, the overall number of words associated with ESG and Sustainability declined between the 2 periods. The reduction in similar words may be associated with an overall decline in the usage of \"ESG\" and \"Sustainability\" in these articles, possibly indicating a retreat from language that the new administration may be hostile towards. Future research should include word frequency analysis for key phrases to determine if this is the case. Furthermore, in both periods words referencing moral responsibility and government appeared including; inequality, responsibility, administration, department, policy, trade, secretary, mandate and poverty. However, after the election, there appear to be closer associations between climate and government and a specific connection between \"climate\" and \"administration\". This may imply that discussions around climate were more focused on the impact of the new administration on climate policy. There is a slight shift detected between the two datasets from private sector words related to \"climate\" and \"sustainability\" towards public sector words. For example, before the election some similar words for \"sustainability\" were, \"executive\", \"operating\" and \"procurement\" that did not appear after the election. The similar word search for \"climate\" before the election included, \"investment\", \"business\" and \"industrial\" which were replaced by more public policy terms after the election such as \"administration\", \"department\", \"policy\", \"trade\" and so on. It is possible that articles were more interested in private-sector efforts before, then switched topics to public sector decisionmaking after the election. Overall, further interpretation beyond this would require more conclusive and divergent results to make generalizations. The full similarity analysis can be found below:"

        "The final piece of analysis conducted on this data was creating word clouds across all articles for each of the two time periods and comparing before and after the election. The word \"Trump\" was the most notable change between the two, having been quite small before the election and then the largest word after the election. This shows that Trump was a primary topic in ESG and Sustainability articles after the election, but less so in the run-up to the vote. \"Policy\" was another word that became much more prominent after the election, suggesting again that journalists pivoted to discussing ESG in the context of public policy. While \"state\" had been the most common word prior, it is significantly smaller afterwards and \"country\" has appeared as a top word, potentially implying that national-level concerns had replaced state-level discussions. The words \"billion\", \"global\" and \"world\" have become more prominent as well, again implying that the scope of sustainability discourse had expanded. Additionally, \"Biden\" does not appear at all in the pre-election word cloud, showing that comparisons between Biden and Trump's approach to these issues may have entered the conversation after Trump was elected or perhaps addressing changes to Biden's sustainability policies that the Trump administration is likely to make. Finally, the word \"clean\" had been fairly prominent prior to the election and the words \"oil\", \"gas\" and \"fossil fuel\" became common words post-election. This may indicate a shift in the conversation around energy sources from renewables to fossil fuels in the weeks following the vote."

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, there do appear to be significant differences between ESG and Sustainability reporting before and after the 2024 general elections. However, the meaning and causes of these changes over time are difficult to derive and the data is not very conclusive in answering the initial research questions posed by this project. While there is some evidence that conservative perspectives on ESG topics became more positive and centrist/progressive sentiment became more negative we cannot ascertain whether this may have been a general shift in mood (regardless of an article's topic) that may have also been true for non-ESG related articles. Additionally, the change in similar words could imply that a greater emphasis was placed on sustainability and its relationship to government after the election, but this would likely be true of any post-election period when all topics tend to be linked to the incoming administration. Finally, while the word clouds show a change in the most prominent words featured in ESG articles, some of these changes are small or ambiguous and require deep assumptions and logical leaps to draw conslusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the only broad conclusion that may be drawn is that the discourse across these 3 sources does appear to have changed from the pre to post election time period and in opposite directions for left/centrist versus right leaning sources. The nuance, relevance, driving forces and implications of these developments are unclear. I would therefore recommend several alternative paths for future research:\n",
        "1. Include more sources than the 3 examined here\n",
        "2. Study these topics across a longer time period\n",
        "3. Apply additional text analysis tools\n",
        "\n",
        "Including a greater number of sources may allow for saturation that will proffer more clarity of outcomes and relationships. Examining these trends over a longer period of time will illuminate how ESG and Sustainability discourse has changed over the years as opposed to just a few months. Shifts in sentiment around ESG topics may ocurr more slowly than could be captured in this research which only covers a brief period. To that end, once more data is available in the future, the relationship between Sustainability and the incoming administration may become more clear. Finally, there are numerous other text analysis tools that were not applied in this research that may be useful, for example Named Entity Recognition may reveal particular individuals, agencies, programs, etc. that could be affected in different ways as a result of the election.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, although this research does not present conclusive evidence to answer our questions about the future of Sustainability and ESG, it is a jumping off point for future research to continue developing tools for understanding this important and complex issue."

The loan has yet to be finalized, but Jay Bellows, the company's president, is optimistic it will move forward even under a Trump administration. Most lithium ion cells today are made in China and moving supply chains to the United States is something both parties can support, he said.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Perhaps the most visible impact of the Inflation Reduction Act so far has been a surge of domestic manufacturing. Four years ago, the United States had hardly any capacity to build solar panels, wind turbines or lithium ion batteries. Most of that happened in China and elsewhere.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That's quickly changing.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The law gave hefty tax breaks to wind and solar developers if they used components made in the United States. It also doled out additional tax credits for domestic clean-energy factories. In addition, billions of dollars in funding from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law have allowed the Biden administration to nurture domestic supply chains.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In West Branch, Iowa, a factory that made nacelles for wind turbines but halted production in 2013 will restart next year.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The law has also poured money into uncertain technologies that might one day help tackle climate change. In South Dakota, the biofuels company <span class=\"companylink\">Gevo</span> is preparing to build a first-of-its-kind plant that will turn cornstarch into 60 million gallons of jet fuel each year to cut airplane emissions. The company plans to take advantage of new federal tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel as well as a $1.46 billion loan guarantee from the Energy Department.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I think the economics work, but project costs are going to be higher on the first plant,'' said Patrick Gruber, <span class=\"companylink\">Gevo</span>'s chief executive. The federal funding was important, he said, ''so we can go build it and prove it can be done.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Despite all the activity, polls suggest that few Americans know much about the Inflation Reduction Act or think it has improved their lives. It can take years for planned factories to get built and staff up.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We're starting to see more members of Congress aware that there are lots of jobs at stake,'' said Jeff Navin, a co-founder of Boundary Stone Partners, an energy lobbying firm.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A race to get money out</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Most of the money in the Inflation Reduction Act flows through tax credits that are effectively uncapped for ten years. But both the law and the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure bill also authorized roughly $182 billion in grants and spending for energy and climate programs over several years.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As the election approaches, the Biden administration has been trying to get as much of that money out the door as possible, making it harder for a future Trump administration to claw back spending.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In August, the <span class=\"companylink\">Environmental Protection Agency</span> announced $4.3 billion in awards to states and local governments that had competed to devise ideas for reducing emissions. Utah won $75 million for a plan to deploy electric vehicles in low-income areas and reduce leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from oil and gas operations. Pennsylvania won $396 million to cut pollution from steel mills and other industrial facilities.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The E.P.A. is now racing to finalize those awards by year's end, so that the funding is fully obligated and can't easily be rescinded.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In mid-October, the Denver Regional Council of Governments finalized its $200 million award from the agency to help cut emissions from buildings by switching from gas to electricity. ''Getting that done was important,'' said Robert Spotts, a program manger at the council. ''I wouldn't say the funds are invincible now, but it would take some pretty aggressive legislation to pull them back.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Other awards over the past year include $6 billion to help cut carbon from heavy industries like steel and cement, $7.6 billion to upgrade electric grids, and more than $8 billion to help rural electric providers switch from burning coal and gas to cleaner alternatives like wind, solar and nuclear power.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >All told, the White House estimates that more than $98 billion of climate and clean energy grant awards in the Inflation Reduction Act have now been announced, or about 88 percent of funding available through the fiscal year that ended in September.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The administration is working to implement the Investing in America agenda as quickly, effectively, responsibly, and equitably as possible, and has been since President Biden signed each bill into law,'' said Angelo Fernández Hernández, a White House spokesman.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That still leaves billions of dollars unspent, including funds to build new transmission lines and money for agricultural conservation. Many states still haven't finalized programs to use federal dollars to give consumers rebates for heat pumps and other efficient appliances.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If elected, Mr. Trump, who has railed against subsidies for electric cars, could try to scrap the law's $7,500 tax credit for consumers to purchase E.V.s built in the United States. He could try to repeal a provision that charges oil and gas companies up to $1,500 for every ton of methane that leaks from their systems. Or he could revise guidelines around certain energy tax credits, making them harder to obtain.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''They might not be able to kill the entire thing, but there's a lot that could be changed,'' said Kevin Book, managing director of ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington-based research firm.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Analysts generally expect that America's planet-warming emissions would be higher under Mr. Trump, who has also promised to increase oil and gas drilling, than under Ms. Harris. But figuring out the exact impact is difficult.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One recent analysis by BloombergNEF estimated that America's wind, solar and battery capacity could triple over the next decade if the Inflation Reduction Act stayed in place and interest rates kept declining. But repealing the law could jeopardize about 17 percent of those expected projects, particularly wind power. Higher inflation or new trade disputes with other countries could further roil the industry.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Solar power and batteries have become cheap enough that installations would quite likely keep growing no matter what, although maybe at a slower pace, said Gregg Felton, chief executive of <span class=\"companylink\">Altus</span>, the largest owner of commercial-scale solar projects in the United States. ''We have a business that is going to grow regardless,'' he said. ''The question is, how fast?''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The pace matters when it comes to climate change. The Biden administration has pledged to cut U.S. emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 to help limit global warming to tolerable levels. Early analyses suggested that the Inflation Reduction Act could help achieve a 40 percent cut.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the law could struggle to achieve its full potential, even in a Harris administration, without major reforms to reduce the yearslong waits that energy projects and transmission lines face in obtaining government permits.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''About half the emissions reductions in the bill depend on us being able to build solar, wind and transmission much faster than we're doing today,'' said Ryan Jones, a co-founder of Evolved Energy Research, an energy modeling firm.

The tremendous loss in places such as Swannanoa, N.C., and Keaton Beach, Fla., shows that homeownership in a world of growing disaster risk is less of an asset than it once was.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Homeownership is not simply a financial decision but also a deeply emotional one. It's core to the American dream, representing financial permanence and a sense of stability for young and old families alike. But climate change is most likely making homeownership more expensive and less predictable in large areas of the country, and it's only getting worse.</p>\n",

Renting is quickly becoming a better way for many people to enjoy these places with much less financial baggage.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One of the biggest reasons homeownership is not what it used to be is the turmoil in property insurance markets. According to a recent report by <span class=\"companylink\">Intercontinental Exchange Inc.</span>, a data and technology firm, the average property insurance payment for a mortgaged single-family home has increased by 52 percent around the country since 2019.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >My research with Philip Mulder at the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Wisconsin</span>, Madison, shows a sharp increase in property insurance in the most disaster-prone parts of the country. In Florida, for example, average premiums have increased by $1,450 between 2020 and 2023. In essence, the insurance industry has decided that the risk of living in certain areas is now greater than before.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For many wealthier homeowners, paying more in insurance premiums isn't a deal breaker. Other homeowners may adjust to growing insurance costs by bearing more of the risk themselves: raising their deductibles, reducing their coverage or dropping insurance policies altogether. But without coverage, families will face crushing losses in the event of a disaster.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A second cost borne by homeowners in a warming world is higher property taxes, in part because towns and cities must pay for resiliency and repair efforts. Those taxes have increased on average by 18 percent for single-family homes since 2019, <span class=\"companylink\">Intercontinental Exchange Inc.</span> found, and growth has been stronger in areas more prone to climate risk. If communities want to protect themselves against future disaster risks, the costs of large infrastructure investments -- like sea walls and improved storm water drainage -- are going to be felt by local taxpayers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >These two costs -- insurance and property taxes -- usually adjust on an annual basis, so they can change quickly, and uncertainty about them is making it harder to budget for the expected costs of homeownership. Historically, buying a house with cash or a fixed-rate mortgage was thought to broadly lock in housing expenses. This is no longer true, with important consequences for retirees on a fixed income or low-income home buyers looking for predictability.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There is also greater uncertainty around the value of the house itself. To date, we've seen little evidence that house prices truly capture the cost of climate change. But the prices of houses in places with growing climate risk should reflect that risk and eventually decline. That means some homes won't end up being the good investments they now appear to be.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >All of those issues with owning are making renting a safer, lower-risk option for many people who want to avoid those costs, maintain flexibility and put their wealth in assets that aren't exposed to weather risk. While landlords still have to take on the risk, they may have more resources for and experience in shopping for insurance, giving them better coverage in the long run.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There are very real downsides to renting. Renters may find themselves needing to move if the property is destroyed, unsafe or redeveloped or if rent increases are too large. Landlords may not maintain the property well, or they may be slow to invest in ways to make it more resilient to extreme weather. In some rental markets, landlords may pass along much of these costs of climate change to their tenants. Many households have also enjoyed the freedom and stability of homeownership for years and don't want to go back to dealing with a landlord.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But at a minimum, the choice between renting and owning should be made with clear information about risks. Unfortunately, since disclosure laws are determined by states, the risk information buyers receive depends on where they live. It was only this past spring that Florida passed a law that requires disclosing certain details about prior flooding to potential home buyers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Stepping into this information void, <span class=\"companylink\">Zillow</span> has followed other property listing websites and is collaborating with First Street, a research firm that studies climate threats to housing, to provide guidance to potential home buyers on risk and insurance needs. The early evidence on whether that kind of information is shaping decisions is encouraging: When <span class=\"companylink\">Redfin</span> experimentally rolled out flood risk information, a team of researchers showed that home shoppers significantly changed how they searched, bid on and eventually bought properties. Timely information helped those buyers make smarter choices that reflected their risk tolerance.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For many Americans, homeownership has felt increasingly out of reach in recent years as higher mortgage interest rates and high home prices have made owning relatively unaffordable. By raising the costs and the uncertainty around being an owner, climate change is only swinging the pendulum farther from the dream of homeownership.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Being a renter might sound like a step backward to some -- a return to your 20s and 30s -- but in this case, it may be worth trading some control for reduced exposure and greater flexibility. A new American dream of renting property near the water -- imagine that.</p>\n",

(It’s hard to not think of a postapocalyptic version of the film <span class=\"colorLinks\">“Nomadland, [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/movies/nomadland-review.html]</span>” in which Frances McDormand’s character lives in her vehicle and wanders from job to job, some of them in Amazon warehouses.)</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In this world, what Mantell evasively describes as “access” is not only severely limited but also appears to be controlled by the title company. Scrutinizing the shipping labels on boxes has become “the only way to know what still exists,” Jen (Donnetta Lavinia Grays) tells her new co-worker, Ani (Deirdre Lovejoy), at a warehouse in Wyoming.</p>\n",

Questions keep arising, like pesky burrs that prevent a full immersion into the story.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mantell fares better with the central band of outcasts, whose advancing years made them invisible or who fall outside the boundaries of traditional sexual and gender roles. (The production is presented in association with <span class=\"colorLinks\">Breaking the Binary Theater [https://www.btb-nyc.com/]</span>.)</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some scenes take place on the warehouse floor as the characters scan outbound boxes and place them on large carts — Emmie Finckel’s scenic design, which economically suggests industry thanks to suspended belts ferrying packages, is an asset in Sivan Battat’s often confusing production. This is a place of soulless, mechanical work, yet it is also one where friendships can flourish. They are further cemented in the parking lot where our merry travelers congregate between shifts, with folding chairs and coolers. They chitchat about work and snacks, and play a game, led by Maribel (Pooya Mohseni), in which they must spot the werewolf in their midst.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Progressively, we also hear of plans to undermine the corporation, with the characters engaging in sneaky resistance against a nightmarish dystopia.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This defiance is one of several intriguing setups but the play feels like a patchwork of tantalizing leads left to fizzle out. Each person, for example, is given a short monologue about life on the road, the freedom it allows and the caution it requires. “Darker is better for sleeping, better for being unnoticed,” Ani says of parking under the lights for her first night in a lot. “But I was afraid to sleep in my truck in the dark.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Yet we don’t really get to know these people, who are more like outlines that need to be filled in. The two exceptions are Jen and Ani, who not only have more back story but actually have things to talk about, and desires to pursue. You can almost imagine the other characters grumbling, “We want preposterous coincidences, too — it’s better than nothing.” ELISABETH VINCENTELLI</p>\n",

Improving the nation’s electric grids could determine whether the United States can increase enough clean energy to meet its climate targets.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Without legislation, a Harris administration would have limited tools to cut emissions further. The E.P.A., which imposed limits on pollution from power plants and vehicles under President Biden, could set new controls on big industrial polluters — steel and cement plants, factories, oil refineries and others.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Prof. Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at <span class=\"companylink\">Princeton University</span>, said it’s unlikely that Mr. Trump could halt the country’s transition away from fossil fuels because federal subsidies for wind, solar and other clean energy are now part of federal law, making them more difficult to erase than regulations.

But decades of sprawling urbanization also drove up Houston's risk of flooding as absorbent wetlands were paved over and more homes were built in flood zones.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This summer, Hurricane Beryl ended in a different kind of disaster. As the destructive Category 1 storm swept across Houston, it ripped out trees by the root, felled power lines and caused more than two dozen deaths -- many not from wind or flooding, but from what followed. The storm knocked out power for more than 2 million Houston residents, many of whom remained without electricity -- and air conditioning -- for weeks as temperatures soared. The situation became dangerous for vulnerable groups, especially the elderly: Houston-area hospitals reported a spike in heat-related illnesses, and Harris County's medical examiner reported at least eight deaths from overheating.</p>\n",

Later reporting found that the utility had struggled to make necessary investments in system reliability while also working to accommodate population growth and respond to extreme weather.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The situation in the Houston region is a stark example of how expanding population and development can combine with rising hazard risk to severely strain critical infrastructure, said Michael Webber, a professor of mechanical engineering at the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Texas at Austin</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The geographic area is growing,'' he said. ''The number of meters is growing. The number of people is growing.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Like many urban centers along California's coast, San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area saw large population losses in recent years. The region's high housing costs have made it difficult for many people to stay, while the rise of remote work has allowed tech and information workers to live further away from their jobs.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Many former Bay Area residents left the state entirely, moving to cheaper metros in Texas, Idaho and other Western states. Others moved further inland in search of affordable housing and more space, often to California's hot Central Valley or to the fire-prone foothills of the Sierra Nevada.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At the same time, wildfires have become more common and more powerful across the state, fueled by rising temperatures, drought and the long-term oversuppression of natural fire.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A 2022 study from the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Wisconsin</span>, Madison, and the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. Forest Service</span> found that the two trends -- more frequent, larger fires and the rapid growth of housing in flammable areas -- have both contributed to the growing destructiveness of Western wildfires.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To reduce risk, in 2008 California put in place a strict building code for high-risk areas designed to make new homes less likely to burn.

Heat risk: Because heat does not pose the same kind of damage to property, <span class=\"companylink\">CoreLogic</span> defines heat risk as consecutive days exceeding 95 degrees Fahrenheit or temperatures exceeding the 98th percentile of local temperatures, as well as the frequency of extreme heat index days. The national maps highlight counties <span class=\"companylink\">CoreLogic</span> identified as high risk for either composite natural hazards or heat risk. The company's composite natural hazard score adds average annual loss rates of individual threats and ranks all U.S. counties according to their risk. The regional maps take a similar approach with individual hazard layers. The composite risk score for acute natural hazards is weighted by financial consequences: toward hazards with the highest potential for loss, such as hurricanes and wildfires, and with less weight on hazards that are less financially impactful, like winter storms, or are less frequent, like earthquakes. County population change data comes from the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. Census Bureau</span> and covers the years 2000 to 2023.

Veils of steam wreathed the landscape of loose rock in eerie half-light.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Through this forbidding terrain – “Viti” is derived from the Icelandic for “hell” – Michelle Parks, a volcanologist with the Icelandic Meteorological Office, picked her way toward the water’s edge one day last August. With a monitor strapped to her hip to warn her if the gases reached dangerous levels, she stooped to submerge a temperature probe in the lake – 26.4 degrees Celsius (79.5 degrees Fahrenheit), consistent with recent readings.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >That was reassuring, at least for the time being. The crater was formed when Askja, a volcano in Vatnajokull National Park in Iceland’s central highlands, uncorked in an explosive eruption in 1875. Askja’s last eruption, in 1961, was milder, and for decades after, the volcano was quiet. But in 2021, Parks and other scientists keeping tabs on it were shocked to find that in just a few months, the volcano had rapidly expanded, uplifting by 11 centimetres (4.3 inches). This phenomenon, called inflation, occurs when magma or pressurised gases accumulate under a volcano, pushing the ground upwards and outwards.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the three years since, Askja’s bloat has reached about 80 cm (32 inches). That uplift, scientists estimate, is the result of 44 million cubic metres (1.6 billion cubic feet) of magma flowing into the existing reservoir around three km (two miles) beneath the surface.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Volcanologists have established a correlation between magma buildup under a volcano and subsequent eruption. But they don’t know exactly how much magma is needed to help trip an eruption. That is why Parks and her colleagues are closely monitoring the temperature and acidity of Viti’s crater lake. A jump in either, indicating that more gases are pushing in from below, would suggest the volcano is moving closer to an eruption. So far, those metrics have remained stable, but the scientists watching Askja don’t take that for granted.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >An eruption could be catastrophic, though smaller ones are much more likely. On the scale volcanologists use to measure the size of explosive eruptions, Askja is capable of one equivalent to that of Mount St. Helens in the U.S. state of Washington in 1980, although its eruptive style would differ. That eruption, which sparked the Australia-born Parks’ lifelong passion for volcanoes, unleashed a force equivalent to 25,000 Hiroshima-type atomic bombs.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The aim of the volcano observatory at the Icelandic Meteorological Office is to monitor the country’s volcanoes for changes in activity, like those now observed at Askja, helping to protect the nation’s nearly 400,000 citizens and the hordes of foreign tourists who visit every year to enjoy Iceland’s world-renowned geothermal attractions.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >However, the team’s work has taken on broader significance. Last year, Parks and colleagues with the University of Iceland received government funding for a pioneering research project across 12 institutions to test a theory that could have dire implications not just for Iceland, but for every person on the planet: Whether the rapid retreat of glaciers as a result of human-caused climate change will trigger increased volcanic activity.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The basic process underpinning the idea is simple. The tremendous weight of glaciers and ice sheets can tamp down volcanoes. When the ice retreats, the downward pressure on the planet’s thin outer crust and much thicker underlying mantle eases, allowing the ground to rebound. This change in pressure spurs dynamic forces beneath volcanoes to produce more magma and alter its movement, influencing eruptions.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“Iceland is essentially one of the best places in the world to study this … because we have both volcanism and glaciers,” Parks said. “At the end of the day, what we’re aiming for with this project is a much bigger picture. It’s the future of volcanic eruptions. How large can they be? … And what’s in store for us in the future, not only in Iceland but for the rest of Europe and potentially farther afield.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >UNCORKING CATACLYSM</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What scientists already know of Iceland’s eruptive history supports the theory.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >When the thick glaciers and ice caps that had covered the North Atlantic island during the last major Ice Age receded between about 15,000 and 10,000 years ago, underlying volcanoes responded with fury. In 2002, scientists calculated changes in Iceland’s volcanic activity over time by analysing the chemical composition of lava rock samples. They found that eruption rates surged an estimated 30 to 50 times during and shortly after the ice loss compared to the preceding Ice Age and recent times.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It was likely a cataclysmic scenario, with a “ridiculous amount of eruptions,” Parks said, as rivers of lava reshaped the island and ash rained into surrounding seas. Askja, too, registered a major explosive eruption during this time.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Once again, scientists say, the elements needed to set off another surge in eruptions are converging. Glaciers now cover just 10% of Iceland, but that ice still weighs on more than half the nation’s 34 active volcanic systems, and it is rapidly melting as global temperatures climb. In the past 130 years, Iceland’s glaciers have lost about 16% of their volume, with half of that in just the past three decades. Scientists predict roughly half of the remaining volume will be gone by this century’s end.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Already, the magma chambers beneath Iceland may be responding to the loss of ice, and not just those directly under glaciers. Askja, which has been free of ice for 10,000 years, and much of Iceland are rebounding because pressure changes from glacial retreat affects large parts of the Earth’s crust and mantle.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Over the last three decades, magma has been produced beneath Iceland at a rate 2 to 3 times what it would have been without the ice loss, according to preliminary modelling results from Parks’ project shared exclusively with Reuters. “More magma is coming in underneath Iceland, and we just don’t need it,” Parks said. “We’ve got enough.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Scientists first theorised in the 1970s that melting ice might impact volcanic eruptions. But only recently have they begun to understand the scale of the potential threat. Four years ago, volcanologists compiled the first comprehensive global database of volcanoes under ice or within five km (three miles) of it, publishing their findings in the journal Global and Planetary Change. They found that some 245 active or potentially active volcanoes around the world met the criteria, from the Andes to North America’s Cascade Mountains and Alaska, to Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula and Antarctica.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The same study also found that about 160 million people live within 100 km (62 miles) of at least one of those volcanoes and that 20,000 people are within the immediate vicinity. Numbers like that underscore the threat if glacial melt were to push more volcanoes to pop off, unleashing deadly floods and mud flows and spewing vast clouds of ash and deadly gases into the atmosphere.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The effects wouldn’t end there. Eruptions rich in carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, could exacerbate global warming, outlasting the sulphur aerosols in the atmosphere that can cause initial periods of cooling. And the volcanoes now known to sit under the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could help speed ice melt into the ocean, raising sea levels.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Evidence suggests that what happened in Iceland after the last Ice Age was duplicated to a lesser extent around the world. Eruptions were between 2 and 6 times higher globally between 12,000 and 7,000 years ago owing to more frequent eruptions in areas that were losing their ice cover, according to a 2009 study in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A VIOLENT HISTORY</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Iceland is uniquely primed for frequent volcanic eruptions because of its location at the juncture of two tectonic plates that are pulling apart over an upwelling of anomalously hot material in the Earth’s mantle. Many smaller eruptions have little impact beyond their immediate vicinity, though they are still able to put on spectacular shows. Others can have lethal effects far beyond Iceland.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >When Laki, southwest of Askja, erupted in 1783-84, the fluorine it expelled contaminated the island’s plants and water sources, killing more than half of Iceland’s livestock. This agricultural collapse led to a famine that killed around a fifth of the island’s human population, while the resulting haze of sulphurous fog that later reached Europe may have contributed to the deaths of thousands more people. And as far away as Africa and Asia, the eruption’s effects weakened monsoons, initiating more famines.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Near the southern coast under a small ice cap lies Katla, considered one of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes under ice. Katla has racked up more than 20 eruptions since the Middle Ages, averaging one every 60 years, and it is past due for another, having last erupted in 1918. During that eruption, heat pouring from Katla’s caldera rapidly melted the ice atop the volcano, releasing a torrent of water greater than the combined discharges of the Amazon, Mississippi, and Yangtze rivers at its peak. And, like Laki, Katla has explosive potential.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“The time for Katla to erupt is coming close... It is high time for European governments and airline authorities all over Europe and the world to start planning for the eventual Katla eruption,\" then-Icelandic President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson told <span class=\"companylink\">BBC News</span> in 2010, following the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull. The ash cloud from that eruption caused €1.3 billion (US$1.4 billion) in losses from cancelled flights during a six-day European airspace ban, making it the world’s costliest eruption in the last century.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Icelandic government has emergency plans in place for a Katla-style eruption and works with local police districts to create near-term risk assessments for other volcanoes.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the government has also tapped its fiery foundation to its benefit, using it to heat homes and businesses and draw big-spending tourists to rejuvenating geothermal baths. After the Eyjafjallajökull eruption, the Icelandic government made volcanoes a pillar of a now multibillion-dollar tourism industry. Souvenir shops in the capital, Reykjavik, sell lava rocks from a recent eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula for 2,000 Icelandic krona (US$14) apiece.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“WATCHING YOUR FRIENDS DISAPPEAR”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Like many Icelanders, 29-year-old Iris Ragnarsdottir Pedersen and her father, 62-year-old Ragnar Frank Kristjansson, have an intimate knowledge of the extremes of their land of ice and fire. Along the south coast in Svinafell, Ragnarsdottir Pedersen, a mountain guide, lives with her husband and their Icelandic sheepdog, Blika. Her father, a retired national park manager, has a small turf-roofed summer house next door. Towering over them is a large cliff, beyond which lies Vatnajokull ice cap and, under it, the volcano Oraefajokull. After Oraefajokull erupted in 1362, sailors reported seaborne pumice floating “in such masses that ships could hardly make their way through it.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Father and daughter both recall joining fellow Icelanders over the years to marvel at the glowing fountains and rivers of lava produced by eruptions. They also are familiar with the impact of climate change.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For 25 years, Kristjansson has volunteered as a glacier monitor with the Icelandic Glaciological Society, tracking the retreat of two glaciers that flow out of the Vatnajokull ice cap, the nation’s largest. Every autumn, he treks for hours to one of the glaciers, Skeidararjokull, to take measurements that he sends to the Icelandic Meteorological Office. “It's a lonely walk toward the glacier — 15 km in the black sand,” he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Kristjansson used to be able to stride right up to the edge of Skeidararjokull. But as it has rapidly shrunk over the past decade, a lake has formed at the foot of the glacier, blocking his way. He now has to use special binoculars to measure the distance. This year, he said, one point along the glacier’s edge showed a retreat of 300 metres (984 feet), which is the greatest he has recorded.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Ragnarsdottir Pedersen has witnessed the retreat from year to year on treks to the glaciers with her father and by simply looking out her windows. “It’s just devastating to see,” she said. “I’ve sometimes said to people, ‘It’s like watching your friends disappear.’ ”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As a child, she knew Oraefajokull lurked under the Vatnajokull ice cap. But it only became a concern when the volcano started rumbling in 2017, just as she and her husband began planning to build their home near it. When she felt the earthquakes and caught the smell of sulphur from the rivers, she said, “You’re like, ‘Oh yeah, we actually have this powerful, quite dangerous volcano right above our home.’ ”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Ultimately, she and her husband weren’t concerned enough to cancel the move, having faith that scientists would closely monitor the volcano for any danger. “People have lived in Svinafell since the settlement of Iceland,” she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A SCIENTIFIC MECCA</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Oraefajokull is one of six active volcanoes covered by the Vatnajokull ice cap. As Vatnajokull has thinned and retreated, some of the volcanoes beneath it, as well as nearby Askja, have become agitated. Oraefajokull has calmed since its 2017 awakening. Grimsvotn and Bardarbunga, two volcanoes under the ice cap that are being assessed in Parks’ project, have together notched five eruptions in the past 30 years, compared with just one under the ice cap in the preceding 40 years.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Parks and her scientific colleagues said it’s too early to conclude that the increased activity under Vatnajokull is linked to rapid loss of ice cover. Other scientists have established that clusters of eruptions can occur in natural cycles under the ice cap. But to determine whether climate change may also be playing a part, they will have to collect more data on ice retreat and magma generation and feed it into complex computer models.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Because of its continuing unrest, Askja is the main draw for scientists, who flock to its enormous calderas when Iceland’s brief summer allows for field research. Like most of Iceland’s volcanoes, Askja does not conform to the stereotypical cone shape of volcanoes such as Japan’s iconic Mount Fuji. Instead, fissures snake across a sprawling Mars-like landscape carpeted with lava rocks and pockmarked with craters from past eruptions.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To reach the centrepiece of the Askja system, an 11-square-km (four sq miles) caldera lake called Oskjuvatn, scientists journey hours across the highlands in Super Jeeps and Land Rovers balanced on 35-inch tires. Oskjuvatn was formed in an explosive 1875 eruption that shot out huge volumes of airy pumice, much of it still covering the area around Askja, with fist-sized chunks tossed about by strong winds.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Above the magma reservoir near the western side of the lake is where Askja has been inflating fastest, a lure for researchers. On a visit in August, Reuters encountered a team of three scientists from the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Geneva</span> at the lake’s edge, loading equipment into an inflatable dinghy. Their aim: to measure carbon dioxide concentrations in the lake and collect water samples from its deepest points.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The data is not easy to get. The numbingly cold and often tempestuous waters are dangerous. Landslides on the caldera’s steep scarp can launch tsunamis big enough to swamp neighbouring Viti crater. In 1907, two German scientists set off onto the lake and were never seen again. The Geneva team’s boat would be the first on the lake in nearly a decade. The <span class=\"companylink\">University of Geneva</span> researchers suited up in thick thermal gear, just in case.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One of them, geologist Nicolas Oestreicher, said the work was important given both Askja’s explosive capabilities and the increased activity around the lake. “If it’s a big explosion, then it’s really dangerous for the people around here, the tourists,” Oestreicher said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >His team, which later returned safely from their boat trip, was one of several from Iceland and abroad that day racing to figure out what was going on at Askja. University of Iceland geophysicist Freysteinn Sigmundsson, co-head with Parks of the government-funded project, was there, too. “Today may be the richest day in all of Askja’s history in terms of the number of scientists here,” he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Sigmundsson has been coming to the volcano almost every year since 1990 and he knows the terrain well. Shouldering a surveying tripod, he clambered with sure-footed expertise across beds of jagged, crunchy lava, searching for round metal markers that scientists anchored in the area in the 1960s and 1970s. These would tell him where to set up his equipment to check how much Askja had grown or shifted over the past year.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The measurements Sigmundsson and his colleagues took in August showed 12 cm (five inches) of uplift at Askja since the previous year, confirming that the volcano was still in a state of unrest and could erupt at any time.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >FROM THE ANDES TO ANTARCTICA</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Regardless of what they ultimately find, the interplay between volcanoes and ice will remain a chief worry among volcanologists. The most deadly eruption in the last 100 years was that of Nevado del Ruiz in the Colombian Andes in 1985. Some 23,000 people were killed after a superheated amalgam of ash, lava fragments and gases known as a pyroclastic flow melted snow and ice near the volcano’s summit, sending massive rivers of mud and debris rushing down the volcano’s flanks.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“Any eruption where there is a possibility of (snow or ice) interacting with the hot stuff adds to the elements of danger,” said Ben Edwards, a volcanologist at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania and lead author of the 2020 study that produced the database of ice-clad volcanoes.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Edwards and his fellow researchers drew up a list of the world’s most dangerous volcanoes that lie under glaciers, based on the volume of ice on or near each one, the frequency of past eruptions, and the population living within 30 km (19 miles). Seven of the top 10, they found, are in the Andes. The most dangerous is Villarrica in Chile, with more than 35,000 people living in its shadow. Edwards is in the middle of a five-year study seeking to understand how Villarrica responded to glacial retreat at the end of the last Ice Age.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The small number of studies to date of the interaction between retreating ice and volcanoes in other parts of the world, scientists said, mean the research underway in Iceland will help create a template for what could happen elsewhere. It’s not a perfect comparison: The underlying plate tectonics in Iceland differ from those in the Andes. Magma reservoirs also lie much deeper in the crust in the Andes than in Iceland, Edwards said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“We don’t have a very good physical understanding of all the processes that control melting (of rock into magma) deeper in the mantle,” said David Pyle, a volcanologist at the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Oxford</span> who studies Chilean volcanoes. “Whereas in Iceland, the conceptual model is much better developed because in a way it’s geologically simpler.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Antarctica, where both ice and volcanoes are abundant, has become an area of concern in recent years. While a handful of volcanoes were known to reside under the vast West Antarctic Ice Sheet, in 2017 scientists reported detecting another 91 possible volcanoes hidden there.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >How many of them are active or have the potential to awaken is difficult to ascertain. “There are probably two or three which are certainly active. But there may be as many as 100 or 150,” said John Smellie, a former senior volcanologist with the <span class=\"companylink\">British Antarctic Survey</span> who has completed 27 field seasons on the continent and won two Polar Medals from the British royals.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If climate change kicks off a new era of eruptions in the coming decades, Smellie said, it would hasten the already rapid loss of the continent’s ice cover due to climate change, adding to rising sea levels and swamping the world’s big coastal cities. Antarctica is shedding more than 150 billion metric tons of ice a year, according to satellite measurements, and scientists believe that as oceans continue to warm, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is fast approaching a tipping point beyond which the melt cannot be stopped.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“If an eruption adds even a small amount to global sea level, it will exacerbate effects already happening due to climate change,” Smellie said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Under the worst-case scenario, rapid melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would ease the pressure on buried volcanoes, triggering eruptions. This in turn would speed up ice loss, awakening even more volcanoes that melt more ice, and so on, leading to global catastrophe. However, Smellie said, that is unlikely to happen because thousands of nearly simultaneous eruptions would be needed to melt even a small proportion of the ice sheet.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >IN THE DANGER ZONE</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Few people make their home near Askja. The closest village lies about 60 km (37 miles) away. But some 13,000 people visit the volcano during the summer months, when Askja is more accessible, according to data from the national park authority. Often, tourists climb down into Viti crater to swim in the <span class=\"companylink\">Instagram</span>-worthy lake, despite signs that warn them about acidic water, which can irritate skin, and falling rock.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >After a week of field work at and around Askja last August, the volcanologists gathered park rangers and local police and lodging staff in a nearby ranger hut one evening for a safety briefing on the state of the volcano.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Parks hovered over her laptop displaying a series of charts and graphs on her most recent findings that showed Askja was still inflating. Sigmundsson, standing in the doorway, explained to the rangers and police that predicting eruptions is an imprecise science; they may not necessarily have weeks of seismic activity as a warning of an imminent eruption. “The time scale can be quite short,” he said. “Hours, maybe … You would want to have a plan if something happens to quickly evacuate the caldera.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One of the greatest risks to tourists is a phreatic explosion — a blast of hot steam, ash and rocks that comes with little warning. That’s what formed Viti crater nearly 150 years ago. In 2019, a phreatic explosion at New Zealand’s White Island volcano killed 22 people who were visiting the island at the time.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At Sigmundsson’s words, the room fell quiet. One of the police officers then piped up with a plan: “We just have to hope that it blows up in the middle of the winter.”</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As president, Mr. Trump demonstrated a reckless disregard for political norms. He made clear that he disdains formal alliances, as they require time-consuming agreements and at times a broad consensus before taking action. He prefers to take unilateral action, certain that our superior economic and military power can bend other nations to our will. Mr. Trump is unburdened by ethical dilemmas or moral ambiguities in dealing with others, be they friend or foe.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Trump has called into question the value of <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span>, promising not to defend any <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span> member that fails to pay its \"dues\" by spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense. He has hinted that he might pull the U.S. out of <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span> and let European members fend for themselves. His isolationist sentiments aren't confined to Europe. He has publicly questioned the need for U.S. military forces in South Korea and Japan. That could cause our Asian allies to consider developing nuclear weapons, which would lead to further global instability. It evokes Churchill's warning that we could one day \"return to the Stone Age on the gleaming wings of science.\"</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It may be that Mr. Trump's blunderbuss rhetoric is designed to bully and badger those he can't otherwise persuade to take action. That approach had some success in inducing <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span> members to increase their financial commitment. But Mr. Trump's flirtations with the benefits of authoritarianism and his admiration of Mr. Putin, who jails and poisons political opponents, should be fair warning of the direction he could take our country.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If America abandons the Ukrainian people or dismisses the value of <span class=\"companylink\">NATO</span>, it will send a strong signal to Beijing that the U.S. may not send forces to help defend Taiwan from provocative actions by China. That lack of resolve would likely cause our Indo-Pacific allies to recalibrate their security relationships. China is their biggest trading partner, and they would be reluctant to risk antagonizing the most heavily armed power in their neighborhood. At the very least, China would expand its sphere of influence beyond the South and East China seas.</p>\n",

Massive storms are capable of sending entire communities into watery graves while the sun can turn water-depleted farms into deserts. Survivors of such disasters could join mass-migration lines in search of safety, only to face the hostile resistance of those who see the hungry and dispossessed as threats to their nations' security.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A Harris administration would likely pursue multilateral measures designed to ameliorate nature's fury. A Trump administration would continue to dismiss climate change as a hoax perpetuated by environmentalists to discourage the continuing extraction of fossil fuels, thereby threatening the oil and gas industries.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Turning to the Middle East, both Mr. Trump and Ms. Harris, after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, pledged unqualified support for Israel's right to defend itself against Iran and its proxy forces throughout the region. But the Biden-Harris administration has cautioned the Israelis to do everything in their power to minimize the killing of innocent Palestinians. This caution not only stems from humanitarian concerns and opposition to the notion of collective punishment; it also reflects concern that when innocent people die at the hands of others, the drive for revenge is likely to last for generations.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Trump has shown little interest in humanitarian concerns, and has simply urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"finish the job.\" In other words, show no restraint or mercy.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The problem for the U.S. is that Israel may take action that risks setting the region in flames, with catastrophic global consequences. It is for this reason that Ms. Harris, following Israel's killing of Yahya Sinwar and <span class=\"companylink\">Hezbollah</span>'s leadership in Lebanon, believes that a small window of opportunity has opened for a cease-fire, the return of <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span>'s hostages, and the outline of a plan for a state in which the Palestinian people can live in peace with Israel. This approach has the chance to \"finish the job\" without sending untold thousands into war's hell.</p>\n",

Ms. Harris has promised to try to bridge America's racial, ethnic, economic and cultural divides. That is a message that should be welcomed abroad and at home.</p>\n",

Over the last few months, heavy rains have flooded every one of Chad's 23 provinces, burst a dam in northern Nigeria, damaged ancient buildings in Niger's desert town of Agadez, and killed more than 1,460 people in the countries on the fringes of the Sahara, according to OCHA.</p>\n",

One issue is that the effectiveness of an AI model is only as good as the information it is fed.

Data processing is also a challenge because these complex AI models need to run updates every hour as forecasts change.

High computing power also means huge amounts of energy and water are needed, which makes AI models part of the problem because they are adding to the planet-heating emissions driving the climate emergency, some scientists say. Other scientists stress that beyond refining their forecasting abilities, authorities need to invest in physical solutions, like developing areas where floodwater can safely be stored, and early warning systems. They also need to minimize development in flood-prone areas, given the likelihood of more intense climate change-driven floods, and meet their commitments to limit emissions.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Beyond the weather, Florida faces other challenges that are compounding the threats posed by climate change.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene killed at least 11 people in Florida and inflicted widespread damage. Last year, Hurricane Idalia was not as bad as feared. But the year before that, Hurricane Ian cut a path of wreckage across the Gulf Coast, the same densely populated area now reeling from Helene and Milton.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Unrelenting development is placing ever more people, homes, businesses and infrastructure in the path of increasingly ferocious storms. That combination will inevitably lead to more damage, and more costly disasters.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''When you're talking about selling every square inch of waterfront property for as much as you can sell it for, with only a cursory glance at what's happening with the climate and hurricanes, it's irresponsible,'' Hiaasen said. ''They built so many houses in the worst possible places, and they get wiped out, and they just put them back in the same place.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Another problem: It's getting harder to insure homes and businesses. Florida is now the most expensive state for homeowners insurance, and some insurers, including Farmers, are pulling out of the state. When the insurance companies can't make money, Hiaasen said, you know things have gotten bad.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >An additional complication is that many of Florida's elected officials are unwilling to acknowledge the risks posed by man-made climate change. DeSantis this year signed a law barring state agencies from considering climate change when writing energy policy.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Despite all this, Hiaasen believes Florida will endure.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The numbers bear this out. Even with storms getting worse and insurance premiums rising, people keep flocking south. In 2022, Florida was the fastest-growing state in the union, attracting almost half a million new residents.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The nature of overdevelopment is that you always find someone else who wants to get out of the tough winters and come to Florida and is willing to take the risk until one storm, two storm, three storms hit, and then they bail,'' Hiaasen said. ''But there will be someone else that's willing to buy that piece of property that's under six feet of water tonight. There will be someone else willing to fall for that dream.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Stuart was mostly spared from Milton's wrath, but has been hit before. In 2004, two hurricanes, Frances and Jeanne, thrashed the city in the course of just three weeks. My family didn't leave then, and they won't be leaving now.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >How to reopen a closed nuclear plant</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The problem: The U.S. aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. But to do that, it'll need cleaner sources of energy. In 2023, about 60 percent of U.S. electricity generation came from fossil fuels, according to the <span class=\"companylink\">Energy Information Administration</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The fix: Two companies, <span class=\"companylink\">Constellation Energy</span> and <span class=\"companylink\">Holtec International</span>, are currently working on restarting shuttered plants that could be test cases for the somewhat retro future of nuclear power in the U.S.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Constellation recently announced plans to restart one of two nuclear reactors at Three Mile Island, the Pennsylvania nuclear plant that it shut down in 2019. Three Mile Island partly melted down in 1979, in the worst nuclear reactor accident in U.S. history.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And in Michigan, <span class=\"companylink\">Holtec</span> is working on restarting the Palisades nuclear plant, which shut down in 2022.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The Biden administration is working ''in a very concrete way'' to restart nuclear plants, Ali Zaidi, the White House climate adviser, told Reuters this week. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what this might entail.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >How it might work: Restarting a nuclear plant takes more than just flipping a switch. First, there's hiring. <span class=\"companylink\">Holtec</span>'s work force fell from 600 to 220 when it shut down, but Nick Culp, <span class=\"companylink\">Holtec</span>'s senior manager of government affairs and communications, said the company intended to be fully staffed by spring. <span class=\"companylink\">Holtec</span> requalified more than two dozen workers to operate the Palisades plant who will also need to be licensed by the <span class=\"companylink\">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Then, there's inspection work. <span class=\"companylink\">Holtec</span> said in August that the plant's primary coolant system had been cleaned. The company is working on inspecting the plant's main turbine and transformers, among other parts, and on moving some of its spent fuel to an on-site storage facility, it said. <span class=\"companylink\">Holtec</span> aims to have the plant up and running again by the fourth quarter of 2025.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\n",
        "                     <span class=\"companylink\">Constellation</span> spent more than a year and a half inspecting the reactor it's working to restart at Three Mile Island, which will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. The company said it planned to spend $1.6 billion to get the reactor operating again and hoped it would reopen in 2028.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Last month, the Biden administration approved a $1.52 billion loan guarantee to help <span class=\"companylink\">Holtec</span> reopen the plant. <span class=\"companylink\">Constellation</span> is also reportedly seeking a federal loan guarantee.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The obstacles: Restarting mothballed nuclear reactors takes a lot of time, investment and regulatory approvals. And it would reverse a trend: More than a dozen reactors shut down in the U.S. between 2012 and 2022.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''A lot of people are watching to see how this goes for us,'' said <span class=\"companylink\">Culp</span>, the <span class=\"companylink\">Holtec</span> senior manager. ''When we restart, I think it's going to change the conversation a bit.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Public opinion on nuclear energy has also been changing. More than half of Americans in 2023 said they were either strongly or somewhat in favor of nuclear energy -- the highest level of public support for the industry in a decade, according to Gallup.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What's next: The Energy Department said, the country will need 200 gigawatts of added nuclear capacity by midcentury to meet increasing electricity demand while reaching net-zero emissions.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But, as Brad Plumer reported, only one other dormant nuclear plant in the U.S. could plausibly be restarted: the Duane Arnold plant in Iowa. Other reactors that have recently shut down are already being dismantled. -- Allison Prang</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The brutal wind and torrential rainfall of Hurricane Milton that killed 16 people in Florida this week were worsened by human-caused climate change, a team of international scientists said on Friday. Global warming made wind speeds around 10% stronger and rainfall greater by between 20% and 30%, according to an analysis by World Weather Attribution. The group of climate scientists studies the role of climate change in fueling extreme weather. Milton intensified from a Category 1 storm into a tempestuous Category 5 in less than 24 hours, feeding off record- and near-record-warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. It made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 hurricane.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Previous scientific analyses have shown climate change has made such temperatures in the Gulf between 400 and 800 times more likely. This extra heat made Milton the third-fastest intensifying Atlantic hurricane on record, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, with maximum sustained wind speeds reaching 180 mph (290 kph).</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The scientist group noted that rainfall storms similar to Milton are now about twice as likely as they would be without human-induced warming.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“This study has confirmed what should already be abundantly clear: climate change is supercharging storms, and burning fossil fuels is to blame,\" said Ian Duff, a campaigner at environmental nonprofit Greenpeace. \"Millions of people across Florida - many of whom lack insurance - now face astronomical costs to rebuild shattered homes and communities.\" Scientists have previously identified a concerning trend of rapid hurricane intensification in the Atlantic over the past 50 years, which they said may be tied to climate change. In light of extremely warm surface-water temperatures around Florida and the Caribbean, forecasters had expected a supercharged Atlantic hurricane season, with between four and seven major storms.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Milton is the second Category 5 hurricane this season, which runs from June through November. There have only been five other years since 1950 that registered more than one Category 5 hurricane in one season, the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span> said.

Analysts John McNally and Neha Sarraf note that countries representing 80% of Canada's export destinations, including the U.S., are implementing or considering tariffs or charges for emissions intensive goods at the border. If Canada repeals its own carbon-pricing system without a suitable replacement, they say goods representing two thirds of total export revenue could see higher costs. And with all top export destinations having or planning mandatory ESG reporting requirements in the next decade, reporting requirements for Canadians could increase.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >0641 ET – Gucci's appointment of Stefano Cantino as CEO comes as no surprise, as the brand continues with its turnaround journey, Equita SIM analyst Paola Carboni writes in a research note. French luxury giant Kering has been trying to revamp its flagship brand with a management reshuffle. Last year, the group announced the departure of former Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri, with Jean-Francois Palus replacing him on an interim basis. The French company also named Sabato de Sarno as Gucci's creative chief in January last year. The appointment of Cantino and the exit of Palus signals that Gucci's managerial reorganization in view of the relaunch is now complete, the analyst says. Shares are up 1.2% at 239.20 euros.

The star label of French luxury giant Kering said Cantino, who served as Gucci's deputy CEO since May, will assume the position from Jean-Francois Palus in the new year. For a brand like Gucci, successful marketing might be just as important or even more important than a strong creative vision, Sokolova says. \"In that sense, Cantino's profile fits the bill,\" she adds, citing Cantino's prior experiences at <span class=\"companylink\">LVMH</span>'s Louis Vuitton and Prada. The situation at Gucci isn't easy to fix, but patience with this stock could pay off for long-term investors, Sokolova says. Shares are up 1.2% at 239.20 euros.

Underground, root networks formed to quietly perform heroic feats, filtering dangerous nutrient runoff from crops, keeping soil in place and bringing new health to the land.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We're thinking about our farm as a small piece of the overall good puzzle,'' said Jon Bakehouse, on a visit to the family's fields one sunny morning earlier this summer. ''On a larger scale, we're all in this together.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The fertile soils of America's vast prairies made the heartland ideal for growing crops. But today in Iowa, less than 0.1 percent of original prairie remains, scattered in fragments around the state.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Prairie strips are helping to reverse that loss, and are being adopted at an increasing clip. Researchers counted 586 acres of prairie strips on farmland across seven states in 2019. As of last year, they had spread to 14 states, filling 22,972 acres.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While the acreage accounts for a tiny fraction of the Midwest's farm fields -- Iowa alone has roughly 30 million acres of cropland -- researchers said the strips had disproportionately positive impacts.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''There are a whole suite of dramatic environmental benefits that come with this small intervention,'' said Lisa Schulte Moore, a professor of natural resource ecology and management at <span class=\"companylink\">Iowa State University</span>, and a founder of its prairie strips project. ''If you put a bit of prairie back, it makes a big difference.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >To be classified as a prairie strip, restored land must adjoin active cropland, reach a width of at least 30 feet and be sown with dozens of native plant species.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Researchers at Iowa State found that when prairie strips were planted in and around soy and corn fields, they acted as both ''speed bumps and diapers,'' Professor Schulte Moore said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Soil erosion and surface runoff plummeted, as the prairie plants held soil in place and transpired water. Levels of nitrogen and phosphorus carried in surface runoff from adjacent cropland decreased by as much as 70 percent, absorbed instead by the prairie strips, resulting in less water contamination. The prairie strips created better conditions for helpful bacteria, resulting in dramatically lower levels of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas generated by chemical fertilizer, compared to cropland without prairie strips. The strips also drew twice as many native grassland birds and three times as many beneficial insects, compared to fields that had not been rewilded.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While the research did not show that prairie strips affected yields in adjacent cropland, tests found that the strips boosted the health and fertility of the soil where they were sown. ''When people buy farms, they're buying the soil,'' Professor Schulte Moore said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The restored land also brought unexpected benefits for humans. Farmers who sowed prairie strips found themselves visiting them to decompress when they were having a bad day, the professor said. Children clamored to play or hunt in them and people stopped by to snip bouquets.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The serenity that you get standing right in the middle of something like this that has so many diverse plants, animals and insects, that moment of calm and away from the busy world, for even just a few minutes, is so important,'' said Jeanne-Marie Bakehouse, who farms along with her brother Jon.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Iowa has the most industrialized livestock farms in the country, and tens of millions of pounds of untreated manure that they produce end up fertilizing crops, along with synthetic fertilizer made from fossil fuels. The nitrogen-heavy runoff from agricultural fields threatens drinking water, and is a leading cause of an oxygen-starved dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico that kills marine plant and animal life.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In 2007, Professor Schulte Moore was part of a team at <span class=\"companylink\">Iowa State University</span> that began researching the ways in which restoring parts of the prairie could enrich soil, help insects and wildlife, and stanch emissions and fertilizer runoff. They went on to plant prairie strips on commercial farms and at some of the university's test sites, and found that benefits were consistently achieved when 10 percent of a farm's cropland is converted into prairie strips, with lower amounts still providing some boons.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The findings might have sat on a shelf, Professor Schulte Moore said, were it not for her department chair, who rewrote the professor's job description so she could promote the idea to farmers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In late 2018, the prairie strips initiative got perhaps its biggest boost when it was included in the federal Conservation Reserve Program. That meant that farmland owners who converted some of their acreage to prairie strips could collect money from the federal government. According to the Agriculture Department, the average payout for prairie strips is $209 per acre each year.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''That was monumental,'' Professor Schulte Moore said. ''It helped align hearts, heads and pocketbooks.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Still, federal payments for prairie strips can end up being less than revenue from livestock or crops. An analysis from <span class=\"companylink\">Iowa State University</span> found that even with government help, prairie strips generally cost farmers around $64 an acre a year, because of factors such as cost of conversion and taxes.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Professor Schulte Moore said prairie strips often offered better options than farming poor-quality land. At the Bakehouse farm in southwest Iowa, much of the acreage they converted into prairie strips had flooded earlier, making it difficult to farm. While prairie strips require maintenance such as mowing and weeding in the early years, and, later on, controlled burns, they need far less work and attention than soy or corn.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''I was a little worried; I thought, do we need the income from our row crops?'' said Nancy Bakehouse, Jon and Jeanne-Marie's mother. ''The more I looked into it, I thought this is absolutely the thing to do for encouraging the insects and the wildlife, and for saving the water.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Still, prairie strips alone cannot solve all the environmental and economic challenges facing Midwestern farmers. Professor Schulte Moore and her team are looking into ways the strips might generate income through honey production, harvesting prairie grasses for bioenergy or livestock bedding and carbon credits. Other possibilities include paying farmers for keeping nitrogen and phosphorus out of the water through the strips, reducing the need for expensive wastewater treatment facilities to filter nutrients downstream.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Another option is underway at Resilient Farms near Red Oak, Iowa, in the southwest corner of the state. The farm has been in Maggie McQuown's family for more than a century. She and her husband, Steve Turman, returned there from Dallas in 2012. To offset the impacts of soy and corn grown by the farmer who rented their land, they planted a dozen prairie strips that are teeming with life today.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While the farmer employed environmentally friendlier no-till and cover crop techniques, Ms. McQuown still worried about the toll of soy and corn, how rising carbon dioxide levels would decrease their nutritional value, and how climate change would lead to dry, lifeless soil.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''The traditional agricultural system is extracting from the soil, killing it, turning it into dirt,'' she said during a recent visit to the farm, as a crop duster roared over a neighbor's fields, dousing them with fungicide. ''We want a living soil, filled with microbes, a whole ecosystem under the ground.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Over the last year, Ms. McQuown arranged for another farmer to lease her land, and, in mid-August, he moved his herd of Scottish highland cows to graze. Grass-fed beef is better for the land than annual row crops, mimicking the beneficial impacts that bison once had across the prairies, while also producing food and generating income, she said. She wants her farm to be 40 percent prairie and 60 percent pasture.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Resilient Farms represents what Professor Schulte Moore sees as the logical next step for land conservation and a viable path forward for some Midwestern farmers. While past studies have shown that industrialized cattle farms emit fewer greenhouse gasses than grass-fed beef, which require larger amounts of pasture, the professor said much of that research fails to fully account for negative impacts of concentrated animal feeding operations.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Such operations, also known as factory farms, have numerous effects on waterways, biodiversity, local communities and the land. Cows spew methane, a greenhouse gas that is 28 times as warming as carbon dioxide, but fertilizers used on crops emit nitrous oxide, which is 10 times more potent than methane. The easiest way to restore grassland while creating local jobs, Professor Schulte Moore said, was by raising grass-fed livestock.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We want people in rural communities, and the easiest way to get young farmers back is through cattle livestock production,'' she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Professor Schulte Moore has a prairie strip of her own that fills four and a half acres of her family's farm in Wisconsin. It catches runoff from their neighbors' soy and corn fields, and is filled with dozens of species of blooming native plants and grasses, including stretches of lupine, planted specially for the endangered Karner Blue butterfly, that form riotous splashes of purple across the fields every June.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''We love it,'' she said. ''This is my attempt to rewild the Midwest.''</p>\n",

The Justice Department trumpeted it as a \"first of its kind\" consent decree, levying a hefty $64.5 million penalty. More interesting than the money were the \"mitigation projects,\" which require Marathon to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. But the <span class=\"companylink\">EPA</span> lawsuit predominantly alleged only run-of-the-mill violations for conventional pollutants that don't affect the climate.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The <span class=\"companylink\">EPA</span> tried to explain away this inconsistency by claiming that the greenhouse-gas reductions are an incidental \"co-benefit\" from cutting conventional pollution. The idea of a mere coincidence is hard to take seriously. The <span class=\"companylink\">EPA</span> itself claimed that its focus was \"mitigating climate change.\" And Marathon agreed to implement a number of greenhouse-gas controls that the <span class=\"companylink\">EPA</span> lacks legal authority to impose on existing facilities.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >So, why did Marathon go along? The court proceedings give a clue. The agreement compels Marathon to take various actions to atone for its past emissions. Marathon must now route a significant amount of oil through its new low-emissions technology instead of \"traditional facilities.\" But Marathon had already said it was committed to doing so.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The law doesn't allow this: Consent decrees can't rely on mitigation projects a company was already planning to pursue. The <span class=\"companylink\">EPA</span> claims that its settlement follows that law because Marathon's commitment remained \"aspirational\" until it was embodied in a consent decree.</p>\n",

As one scholar <span class=\"colorLinks\">has noted [https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?params=/context/mlr/article/4480/&path_info=6._20Hester.pdf]</span>, the <span class=\"companylink\">EPA</span> will often \"offer more favorable terms to the first industry members who settle\" to get the ball rolling. Then the <span class=\"companylink\">EPA</span> goes to the next target and asks, in the words of one <span class=\"companylink\">EPA</span> bureaucrat, \"What's your exposure\" under the first consent decree? You're free to object to this, of course, much as one is free to decline the services of a mafia protection racket.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It shouldn't be this way. Congress, private industry, watchdogs and judges should scrutinize the <span class=\"companylink\">EPA</span>'s consent decrees to ensure that the agency isn't stretching its authority to reach agreements that set the stage for yet more overreach.

The report found that the Northeast coast, from New York to Maine, had more than 200,000 acres of eelgrass meadows and salt marshes.

And it has done so by linking performance objectives to executive pay.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The candy company, one of the largest privately held firms in the U.S., revealed in its sustainability report this summer it had reduced its carbon footprint by 8% in 2023. That's no mean feat when most businesses are seeing only increases in their emissions numbers.</p>\n",
        "</td></tr><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" class=\"index\"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But when compared with Mars's 2015 baseline, the achievement seems even more striking. The company, which has a goal of cutting emissions by 50% by 2030, has reduced its total emissions by 16%, or 5.7 million metric tons, in that time. And it has done so while growing the business 60% to more than $50 billion annually, according to the report.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mars has also worked closely with its suppliers in an effort to lower their emissions – what Mars reports as its Scope 3 emissions. The company estimates that 96% of its total carbon footprint in 2023, or around 29 million metric tons, came from its indirect operations, including suppliers, 65% of which were related to agriculture and changing land use. \"So we have to change something,\" said Parkin.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >WSJ Pro Sustainable Business interviewed Parkin last month shortly after Mars released its sustainability report. The conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >WSJ Pro: Mars has just released its latest sustainability report. What are the biggest challenges that the company faces in this area?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Barry Parkin: We're making strong progress on GHG reduction. We delivered an 8% reduction last year, which is a stellar move forward on our path to minus 50% in 2030. We're now at minus 16% [against a 2015 baseline]. At the same time we've continued to grow the business strongly—more than 60% since 2015. So we've decoupled our growth from our carbon footprint, which is of course what we need to do and what the world needs to do.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But we're having to completely redesign and reimagine our supply chains. To get to net zero we've got to transform every single part of it. We have a big supply chain. Our carbon footprint is the size of a small country and we have more than a million farmers in more than a hundred countries around the world. So this is an all-in effort across the whole organization.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >WSJ Pro: Your progress on emissions is in contrast with a lot of companies, whose Scope 3 figures have for the most part been up. How have you done it?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >BP: We've made our sustainability goals as important as our financial goals. And 20% of our overall executive remuneration is attached to our sustainability goals. When you make it that amount of money—and it's a significant amount of money for senior executives—they move from ‘I don't know what to do about that. I wasn't trained on how to reduce greenhouse gas. They didn't teach me about that at business school,' to ‘That's serious. That's significant. What do I need to know? What do I need to do?'</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >We've made this as important as the financial goals and that sounds simple but that's what matters. We're investing more than a billion dollars over the next few years on climate, more than two billion dollars on our overall sustainability. These are serious amounts of money—just as much as we'd be investing in building factories or acquiring businesses. So we have made it as important. Unless you do that, you haven't got much chance of achieving these goals.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >WSJ Pro: Would you part company with a supplier if they weren't coming up to scratch or weren't aligning with your net zero goals?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >BP: Absolutely. I have the title of Chief Sustainability Officer and Chief Procurement Officer for a reason. We have to transform our supply chains and that means we have to change what we buy, or where we buy it, or how we buy it, or who we buy it from. If we don't change any of those things, we're not going to transform our supply chain and our greenhouse gas footprint. So suppliers have to be on board and we need to see them have the same serious ambition, set the same goals, but also get on with it.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One of the things we talk about a lot is moving from promises to performance. It's very easy to promise a net-zero goal for 2050. But how many CEOs, how many chairmen are going to be around in 2050? How many chief sustainability officers? None of us. So if we set a goal, it will happen. We need to hold ourselves to account on our performance. Full scope. This isn't about Scope 1 and 2. This is everything in. Absolutely nothing left out.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >WSJ Pro: Are you confident that Mars will meet its 2050 net zero goal?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >BP: I am increasingly confident, yes. We have a very detailed road map to minus 50% in 2030. We know what to do and we know we can do that with existing technology. We don't need any massive breakthroughs to halve our footprint by 2030. And we know it's affordable. We've costed it. Post 2030, it will get harder and we do need some breakthroughs in terms of transport and technology. We're going to need ships that have completely different fuel. We're going to need breakthroughs in some packaging materials and in raw materials.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And of course, it's net zero for a reason. The science says that agricultural commodities will probably not get to zero and there will need to be some high-quality carbon credits at the end. So the last 10%-20% will probably have to get there through high quality carbon credits. That's the ‘net' of net zero. It doesn't say zero. It says net zero. But that'll be at the end of the journey.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >WSJ Pro: You have a goal of 100% renewable electricity in your operations by 2040. How's that coming along?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >BP: You start with putting up a wind turbine at a factory or putting some solar on the roof of your offices and you quickly realize you're never going to get to scale like that. So these last eight, nine years we've been putting in place large-scale off-site renewable projects—wind or solar—at a national scale. We're putting up offtake agreements, typically 20 years. The developer builds a wind or solar farm for us. And we put renewable energy on the grid at large scale and offset our electricity usage in our factories and operations. It's roughly cost parity with fossil fuels. So this is a no-brainer. Everybody could and should be electrifying their business. It's pretty straightforward. I'd say it's at the top of the list of things we know how to do.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >WSJ Pro: Mars is invested in a number of coral-reef restoration programs. Why the sea? You don't immediately associate Mars with the oceans.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >BP: It's not obvious, is it? In fact, our pet-food business is reliant on fish—cats like fish-flavored recipes. So we buy fish from all over the world. And a lot of the fish is spawned on coral reefs. So they are critically important in our supply chain. More than 10 years ago, we developed a process for rebuilding reefs that have been destroyed—often by fishing with explosives, particularly in Southeast Asia. We've got a system where we construct interlocking \"hexapods\" to rebuild reef infrastructure. Within three years, you get a completely new reef. Then the fish come back and you start to see the ecosystem working again.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >We've done the biggest coral reef restoration project in the world in Indonesia. We're now trying to scale it. What we need is serious money. I think something in the order of 200 times the amount of money that's being invested in coral reef restoration globally is needed. So this is a pitch, we need funders to work alongside us on coral reefs.</p>\n",

And, like, everybody. But there’s simply no way that the middle class and lower income groups are going to accept the kind of transformation that is needed if you don’t ask for a much bigger effort from the people at the top who are typically giving lessons to the rest of the world about what we should be doing, while they themselves are taking private jets.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If you look at the driver for change in Sweden, it was really more of a collective mobilization. And it’s actually quite impressive to see that Sweden until 1910 or 1920 was one of the most unequal countries in Europe, and in the world, including a very elitist political system where only the top 20 percent richest male individuals had the right to vote. There was a collective mobilization by the trade unions and social democrats to put the state capacity of Sweden to the service of a completely different political project.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Yes, exactly. At some point we have to replace market valuation by a sort of political valuation and democratic valuation in the sense that, at some point, we have to trust democratic deliberation, at the local, national and federal level to try to decide what’s valuable for us.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Since investors have been making free choices to reject this costly political fad, Biden appointees at the SEC have acted to force it upon them. It seems that a part of the strategy is simply to bury the U.S. economy in paperwork. Mr. Tice writes:</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The SEC's climate disclosure rules will force the management of all registered companies to act as meteorologists and report every conceivable weather impact to their businesses over exceedingly long investment horizons. These companies will be required to describe any climate-related physical risks that \"have materially impacted or are reasonably likely to have a material impact\" on the company's business strategy, results of its operations, or financial condition. The SEC defines physical risks as the actual or potential negative impacts of extreme weather events and changes in long-term weather patterns on a registrant, which is more accurately described as weather risks, both short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic).</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Yet weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, and even wildfires are all natural phenomena that move in both seasonal and longer-dated cycles over a span of decades. There is no credible science to distinguish between naturally occurring weather events and so-called climate-related natural disasters, or to attribute the severity of individual storms to the effects of man-made climate change.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Slight changes in temperatures and sea levels are imperceptible and have no impact on business decision-making. By conflating weather risk with climate risk, the SEC will ensure that U.S. businesses default to a very detailed level of weather-related disclosure—both historical results and hypothetical forward projections—so as to not run afoul of the Commission. Companies subject to the SEC rules will need to report all capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred (net of insurance recoveries) due to \"severe weather events or other natural conditions,\" subject to very low minimum disclosure thresholds set at the greater of 1% or $100,000 for the income statement and $500,000 for the balance sheet. For perspective, the mean equity market value of the S&P 500 index of companies was $96.9 billion as of July 31, 2024.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Of course the production and use of fossil fuels are the main targets and regulators intend to stigmatize these companies as allegedly risky if they are not transitioning at full speed away from efficient energy sources. Mr. Tice writes:</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >By adopting carbon emissions as the \"central measure and indicator of the registrant's exposure to transition risk\" and the gauge for how companies are managing such risk, the SEC's goal is plain. The only way for issuers to reduce their transition risk is by shrinking their carbon footprint. For traditional energy companies, the only way to do this is by ceasing operations or going into a whole new line of business (green or otherwise). The Commission's rules spell out the various threats posed by transition risks, all of which directly relate to the traditional energy industry.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Tice explains why the ends are even worse than the means, and what will happen if only economies like ours are forced to decarbonize while developing countries continue rationally to use efficient fuel:</p>\n",

In fact, since 1990, roughly 67% of the aggregate increase in worldwide fossil fuel primary energy consumption has been driven by the six low- and middle-income countries commonly referred to as the BRIICS nations: Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa. This same BRIICS sovereign grouping accounted for 74% of the total increase in global greenhouse gas emissions over the 1990–2022 period. In 2022, the six BRIICS nations accounted for approximately 47% of worldwide emissions, with China and India alone generating 82% more emissions than the U.S., Canada, U.K., and E.U. combined.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What makes this meadow possible is the height of the panels. A prairie restoration firm had told ENGIE, the owner and developer, that taller panels would allow for a sharp increase in native vegetation species, providing much more ecological diversity, said John Gantner, the director of engineering and delivery for ENGIE’s smaller-scale sites.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The price of the additional steel and the native seeds were “insignificant to the overall project cost,” Mr. Gantner said.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But many other projects, especially big utility-scale sites, avoid the taller panels. Margins are razor tight, developers say, and the higher costs up front feel too risky or even insurmountable.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“When I sit down and do a utility-scale solar project seed mixture, and I look in my toolbox, it’s like I have a rusty screwdriver and a roll of duct tape,” said Peter Berthelsen, a wildlife biologist who runs a company that specializes in creating habitat for solar projects.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >So he scours his sites for any patch of land that doesn’t have panels. In those areas, which he said often encompass 10 or 20 percent of a given site, he plants a native pollinator mix of at least 40 species.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Under the panels, he and others often turn to Dutch white clover.

(Honeybees pollinate plants and make a delicious food for people, but ecologists generally don’t view them as wildlife in need of conservation.)</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The more plant diversity allowed under the panels, Mr. Berthelsen said, the more environmental benefits will follow. Still, he cautioned, it’s important to “not let the pursuit of perfect be the enemy of doing something good.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In measuring ecological value, the starting point is fundamental, scientists say. Replacing a field of row crops with solar panels and clover would provide a net benefit for pollinators, even without a mix of native species. On the other hand, no amount of high-quality seeding will match the ecological value of an intact ecosystem, especially in places where solar panels would require the removal of trees or shrubs.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Nationwide, it’s unclear what portion of solar farms include any kind of pollinator habitat.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Four years ago, a project was in development outside Sacramento.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One aspect of the project, developed by Lightsource BP, which is co-owned by the oil and gas giant, raised questions from the beginning: Diverse pollinator vegetation was restricted to a garden on roughly 1.5 acres of the 67 acre site in an area underneath transmission lines.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Throughout the panels, the company said it would use a seed mix of five native grasses and a smaller amount of native clover. That’s better than turfgrass, scientists say, but it doesn’t come close to the benefits from a more diverse assemblage. At the time, Lightsource BP <span class=\"colorLinks\">defended its decision [https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28112020/pollinator-friendly-solar-greenwashing-risk/]</span> to a reporter for Inside Climate News, claiming that the entire site would be pollinator friendly.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Hernandez of U.C. Davis wished the project was going further. But she was pleased about one thing: a pledge to plant more than 200 native trees and shrubs along the perimeter, on the edge of a rural neighborhood.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But when she drove by last year, Dr. Hernandez said, she didn’t see any plantings.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In May, Dr. Hernandez accompanied me to Wildflower. The 200 trees and shrubs, promised both in planning documents submitted to the county and in marketing materials, were nowhere to be seen. Instead, the area was overgrown with invasive grasses and noxious weeds like yellow star thistle, which the state has spent millions trying to eradicate. After tromping through shoulder-high, dried-out vegetation, we found the remnants of a few plantings underneath.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“There’s not enough plants here,” Dr. Hernandez said. “And there’s no vegetation management.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In an interview and follow-up emails, representatives of Lightsource BP said the trees and shrubs had been planted around fall 2020 and blamed droughts for their demise. They said they had instructed their landscaping contractor “to solicit replacement plantings and a robust, multiyear care plan for the landscaping trees and shrubs.” They did not say why the problems had not been addressed earlier.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Alyssa Edwards, who leads environmental affairs and governmental relations for Lightsource BP, said the company was a leader in the industry when it came to biodiversity.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“It really is in our ethos, and it’s embedded into the way we develop, construct and operate projects,” Ms. Edwards said. The company’s <span class=\"companylink\">Facebook</span> page regularly posts about its commitment to biodiversity. But she was clear: “We do not raise our panels to accommodate pollinators.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At least 15 states have some kind of pollinator scorecard, meant to guard against greenwashing by awarding points for various ecologically valuable features. States do not require certification, but in many cases a project must achieve a certain score to declare itself pollinator friendly.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the scorecards have been criticized as both too weak and too stringent. On one hand, they typically lack a mechanism for monitoring, simply relying on a company’s promises. On the other, developers say some of the standards are not feasible given realities on the ground. When some local governments started mandating use of the scorecards, some in the industry pushed back, saying it could have a chilling effect on solar development.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A new nongovernmental certification is in the works, a partnership between the <span class=\"companylink\">Electric Power Research Institute</span>, an industry-funded research group, and the Xerces Society. But the effort has proceeded slowly as partners try to find compromise between the needs of the solar industry and the needs of nature. The current draft would require 15 percent of vegetated areas on the site to include a diverse mix of native, pollinator friendly vegetation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“On one side, we want to protect biodiversity and pollinators. On the other side, we need the most efficient way to get kilowatt hours to customers, to power at the plug,” said Jessica Fox, a conservation biologist with the electric power institute. “So we’re doing this work now to find where is a middle space.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Among the challenges developers face: Higher upfront costs are no guarantee of greater savings. Landscapers with the right experience can be hard to find, as can native seeds.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Not every site is even appropriate for pollinator habitat, Ms. Fox noted. And even when they are, each has its own distinct characteristics. Climate, topography, soil type and other factors all change the palette of possibilities. For example, not far from Wildflower, at a site called Rancho Seco Solar II, the presence of endangered salamanders made it difficult for scientists to prepare the soil before planting a research plot with three native seed mixes.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The site’s owner, the <span class=\"companylink\">Sacramento Municipal Utility District</span>, sees more promise in creating a hedgerow of more than 300 native shrubs and perennials along the perimeter of the site, which can increase habitat connectivity without complicating matters with the solar panels.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Hello! Today's newsletter tackles three key questions about the U.S. elections and clean energy: What would a Donald Trump presidency mean for climate and energy policies? What is Joe Biden's energy legacy? And what to expect from Kamala Harris if she becomes president. It seems Trump would rescind many of President Biden's clean energy rules while also speeding approvals of power plants to meet rising U.S. electricity demand. One of the most significant rollbacks would be removing the U.S. from the Paris agreement on climate change as Trump did during his 2017-2021 White House term. But what about Biden's presidency? What is his climate and energy legacy? U.S. oil and gas production hit the highest levels of any country ever, despite his administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which contains hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for clean energy such as wind, solar, hydrogen, geothermal projects.</p>\n",

Those rules are aimed at slashing carbon emissions from the power industry while also pushing the auto industry to transition to electric cars to cut tailpipe pollution. Trump \"will immediately stop all Biden-Harris policies that distort energy markets, limit consumer choice and drive up the costs on consumers on day one,\" David Bernhardt, his former Interior Department secretary, told reporters in a call organized by the campaign.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >New power plants Bernhardt said Trump would also implement rapid approvals for energy projects and \"the construction of hundreds of new power plants,\" without detailing how those would be fueled. Trump would \"modernize\" the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span> to speed approvals for new nuclear plants and for existing ones to have their lives extended, Bernhardt said.. \"There's been legislation to address some of these issues, but there's a long way to go\". In April, Biden's Environmental Protection Agency finalized rules targeting carbon, air and water pollution from power plants. These will effectively require coal-fired power plants and new natural gas-fired generators in the coming decade to capture emissions.</p>\n",

Just last week, the Democratic presidential candidate told CNN that she would not ban fracking if elected president. \"As vice president, I did not ban fracking.

DEI and excellence go hand in hand.”</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Two of the biggest questions researchers want to answer: How much time do you need to spend in smoky air to suffer health effects? And how smoky does the air have to be for that to happen?</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >One metric of wildfire smoke pollution is the air-quality index, which measures five pollutants on a scale of 0 to 500. Generally speaking, A.Q.I. levels over 100 are considered potentially risky for children, older adults and those with heart or lung diseases, and levels over 200 are considered ''very unhealthy'' for everyone.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Researchers are just beginning to study how different levels of air pollution might affect health by tracking the outcomes of wildfire survivors over time. After a fire in 2017, researchers at the <span class=\"companylink\">University of Montana</span> looked at members of a community that was exposed to heavy smoke for six weeks and followed them for two years.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Over those six weeks, the average A.Q.I. in the area was about 221. The researchers didn't see any changes in participants' lung function at first. ''But then, in the next year or so, they started to see that lung function had declined,'' Dr. Montrose said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Research also suggests that these effects could be cumulative, meaning that your risk can increase over time as you face more exposure. People who are frequently exposed to high levels of smoke, like some firefighters, can develop serious problems. Their lung function can decline, and they can develop higher levels of inflammation. They may also have an increased risk of lung cancer.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Researchers don't have the data to determine whether it is more harmful to experience high levels of smoke for a short period or low levels for a long period, but they are sure of this: As the number of smoky days in the United States increases, many Americans will be at elevated risk as smoke affects them year after year.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >''There's been a shift from looking at kind of daily and weekly level exposures to looking at annual or multiyear exposure, since there are now chronically exposed communities,'' said Stephanie Cleland, an environmental health scientist and assistant professor at <span class=\"companylink\">Simon Fraser University</span>.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >How to Protect Yourself</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >If smoke is in the air, try to stay indoors with your windows shut, she said, especially if you have a chronic condition that puts you at higher risk. Dr. Gould recommended using an air purifier indoors if possible. (You can make one by taping a furnace filter over a box fan.)</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >It is not always possible to avoid going outside on smoky days. If you must, avoid strenuous exercise and wear an N95 mask.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There aren't clear answers on when, exactly, you should avoid smoke exposure outdoors, but public health officials often issue health warnings when the A.Q.I. is over 100.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Cleland recommended that people check air-quality reports during summer and fall, the same way they might check the weather. ''People tend to react if they can see, smell or feel smoke,'' she said, ''but health impacts happen before it reaches that level.''</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Two years ago, on a tree-lined street in Princeton, N.J., a truck-mounted drill arrived at a modest two-story home. Its goal? To dig a 500-foot hole in the front yard.</p>\n",

Forrest Meggers, an engineering and architecture professor at Princeton University, was installing a geothermal heating and cooling system for his house, which he was also gut-renovating to be a showcase for green living.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Dr. Meggers, 43, who teaches a course called “Designing Sustainable Systems,” is not your average D.I.Y.-er. Though he speaks with the drawl of a surfer and lives in what is starting to look like a gingerbread house, he is all business when it comes to lowering greenhouse emissions as society stubbornly clings to fossil fuels.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“We’re basically driving with our seatbelts off at 100 miles an hour right now,” he said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >With his curious neighbors looking on, he is making his house a live-in laboratory. The ongoing construction, which began three years ago, has tested the patience of his family of six. But when the home is also a real-time model for fighting climate change, the risks and rewards can multiply, and the projects can seem endless.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The renovation has gone $40,000 over its $300,000 budget so far. For a year, the professor and his wife, Georgette Stern, also 43, had to move their bedroom and makeshift kitchen to the basement, where Ms. Stern cooked for the family using a hot plate and a slow cooker. “It was rough,” she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“Forrest is a little bit non-compromising with his ideals,” said Ms. Stern, who got her engineering Ph.D. along with her husband, but left academia when the couple’s first of four daughters was born. “He pushes you beyond what you thought was possible,” she continued. “But sometimes I have to draw a line.”</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As an undergraduate at the University of Iowa studying mechanical engineering, Dr. Meggers originally wanted to design bicycles for environmental reasons, he said. But then he learned more about the effects of climate change. “I realized, ‘Oh, my god, buildings are terrible,’” he said. Gradually, he switched his focus to architecture and engineering.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At his lab at Princeton, called <span class=\"colorLinks\">C.H.A.O.S. [https://chaos.princeton.edu/]</span>, which stands for Cooling and Heating for Architecturally Optimized Systems, Dr. Meggers and his students are developing heating and cooling techniques that he often tests at home. A self-taught builder, the professor has incorporated both cutting-edge technology as well as more traditional conservation methods.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Geothermal, a centuries-old technique to harness energy that is experiencing a resurgence across the country (including on <span class=\"colorLinks\">college campuses like Princeton [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/climate/geoexchange-climate-colleges-heat.html]</span>), was just the beginning for him.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There are various ways of using geothermal energy, but Dr. Meggers’s system taps into deep underground water that retains a constant temperature of about 50 degrees. Then, a <span class=\"colorLinks\">heat pump [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/14/nyregion/heat-pumps-climate-change.html]</span> distributes the water through the home via a network of pipes under the floor, in what is known as a <span class=\"colorLinks\">radiant heating system [https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/radiant-heating]</span>. (In the summer, the heat pump can be reversed to extract heat from the house, keeping it cool.)</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Other aspects of the project have centered on maximizing the space of the family’s house without making it bigger. The concept is important to the professor, who eschews hulking American homes and their elevated energy demands. But it was the practicality of the plan that appealed to Ms. Stern. “We have four kids and a small house,” she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Now, each daughter — ranging in age from 9 to 13 — has her own room on what used to be a cramped, two-bedroom second floor. The demolition of the upstairs involved a new roof and floors, under which Dr. Meggers installed the pipes for the radiant system. This allowed air ducts to be removed, opening up more space and making way for the girls’ private bedrooms.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The floors covering the pipes are reclaimed wood from ash trees killed by invasive insects. There is also a bedroom door made from a local red oak that had to be cut down, insulation courtesy of sheep’s wool from the professor’s family farm in Iowa and a sink atop a toilet that reroutes water from washing hands to flushing.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >There are other green houses in Princeton, said Abel Smith, a local sustainable builder who has helped with the renovation and co-organizes <span class=\"colorLinks\">annual tours [https://princetongreenhousetour.my.canva.site/]</span> of the homes. But the Meggers house “is a standout,” Mr. Smith added, because it is so comprehensive in its sustainability features. “He did it all,” Mr. Smith said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But it hasn’t all gone smoothly. Ms. Stern had to tap the brakes on her husband’s seemingly boundless energy when he turned to the kitchen. “This made me crazy, since I’m the one who cooks,” Ms. Stern said. And when Dr. Meggers insisted on pricey cedar shakes for the roof, Ms. Stern negotiated a compromise. They ended up putting cedar on the dormers and asphalt everywhere else. Asphalt shingles are cheaper but not as environmentally friendly.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The family has also questioned the professor’s cooling system, which depends on cold water under the floors, monitored by sensors that keep the sub-floor temperature above the dew point, when condensation occurs. But during a New Jersey summer, the dew point can exceed 70 degrees, which means the floors can grow warm.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“I know he’s trying to make our house more eco-friendly and stuff,” said one of the twin daughters, Maelin Meggers, 11, on a balmy day in October. “But it’s not as cold as other houses.” In the interest of keeping his wife and daughters happy, Dr. Meggers has built a system of coils and fans that cool the air on sweltering days.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The exterior of the home incorporates another design element that allows for natural heating and cooling: passive solar shading. On the south side of the house, Dr. Meggers built hooded windows. A low winter sun hits beneath the ledge to warm the house while the high summer sun hits the ledge, which shades the home.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“It’s what people have been doing since the Anasazi Cliff dwellers built their caves on the sides of the mountain,” Dr. Meggers said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The to-do list for the house includes solar panel installation. Once that is complete and the home goes off the grid, two 530-gallon “water bladders,” an unconventional spin on thermal storage tanks, will reduce the need for battery power. These small, malleable bags, which are stuffed into a crawl space in the basement, allow for heating and cooling to be distributed without the electrically-intensive heat pump.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >More esoteric projects, which are being developed in the C.H.A.O.S. lab, include fine-tuning the zoned sensors and trying out different desiccants to take humidity out of the home. Both initiatives contribute to cooling a house without air-conditioning, which Dr. Meggers described as a wasteful process.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“I’ll be done as soon as I stop having ideas,” Dr. Meggers said. But the house is already a home, he added, especially since the daughters have their own rooms and there are working bathrooms and a kitchen.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Earlier this year, a mechanical engineering class from Princeton visited the house. Helena Frudit, a senior, was impressed with how much sustainable work had been completed on a street so close to town, as opposed to “off the grid in the middle of nowhere,” she said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >“He showed us that you don’t have to be in the middle of the forest to have a cleaner house,” she said.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The town said Duke Energy's actions were costing its residents millions of dollars because climate change had increased damage from floods and other extreme weather. Duke Energy, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., provides electricity to more than eight million customers in six states and natural gas to almost two million customers in five states. The company is one of the biggest operators of coal and natural gas power plants in the United States.</p>\n",

Many utilities, including Duke, have made commitments to increase their use of forms of energy that do not emit greenhouse gases.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But some energy experts are concerned that the utility industry's efforts to reduce its emissions could falter as it works to provide a lot more power to computer data centers for artificial intelligence services.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >During that meeting, the lawsuit claims, a leading scientist explained to industry executives that by 2000, higher use of fossil fuels would raise the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 25 percent. According to the lawsuit, the scientist said this increase ''might, therefore, produce major consequences on the climate -- possibly even triggering catastrophic effects.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Rather than act on the warning, the lawsuit said, Duke engaged in a conspiracy to conceal the causes and consequences of climate change, delaying the transition away from fossil fuels. In a 2004 annual report, one of the utility's acquisitions, Cinergy, claimed that there was ''an unresolved but robust debate on the 'science' of global warming,'' according to the lawsuit.</p>\n",

        "</td></tr><tr><td align=\"right\" valign=\"top\" class=\"index\"><p><b>TD</b>&nbsp;</p></td><td><p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What does this mean for ESG? A potential Trump tariff on Mexico and Canada will mainly introduce new ‘S’, social, and ‘G’, governance, risks. The threat of tariffs could be a way of attaining leverage over Mexico and Canada in the lead-up to renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, set to be reviewed in 2026, said Peter Tabor, an attorney and senior policy advisor at Holland & Knight and a former USDA trade official. But implementation of steep tariffs over time could mean the U.S. may be seen as an unreliable trading partner and that importers of U.S. goods would look elsewhere to fill the void, Tabor said. As for business. companies reliant on North American trade may face new governance risks, including compliance challenges, unpredictability in cross-border regulations, and stakeholder pressure to respond to rising costs or relocate operations. Additionally, companies have also mentioned that the tariffs would potentially lead to job losses, causing social instability and raising concerns about worker protections and fair wages.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Who will be affected? In short, everyone. Businesses, workers and consumers. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico would retaliate if Trump followed through with his proposed 25% across-the-board tariff, a move her government warned could kill 400,000 U.S. jobs and drive-up prices for U.S. consumers. Autos, agriculture, energy, retail, and hospitality are some of the industries that will be directly impacted. Here’s how: Autos: The tariffs could hit profits of U.S. automakers, especially General Motors, and raise prices of SUVs and pickup trucks for U.S. consumers. GM employs 125,000 people in North America; a decline in sales of its Mexico-made cars could hurt its profit for the entire region, potentially putting pressure on payrolls on both sides of the border. While the company that imports goods into the U.S. directly pays the tariff, that cost is inevitably passed on to the consumer via higher prices. Agriculture: The tariffs could also push prices higher for fertilizer imported from Canada at a time when farmers are paying nearly 50% more for fertilizer than in 2020, said Sam Kieffer, vice president of public policy for the American Farm Bureau Federation, a farmer trade group. Energy: About 70% of crude oil barrels imported from Canada go to Midwest U.S. refiners that supply an area that includes Chicago and Detroit. Many of those Midwest refiners are configured to run heavier oil and would either struggle to find a direct replacement for Canadian oil or face paying a higher price if that oil is subject to tariffs. That could drive up fuel costs in the Midwest. Retail and hospitality: U.S. consumers would feel the impact at grocery stores and restaurants, with items being out of stock, Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, said. Alfredo Ramírez, governor of Michoacan, Mexico's main avocado-producing state, said tariffs would not throttle demand. \"It would generate an inflationary spiral,\" he said. \"What would increase are costs and prices. This would bring us an increase in inflation and direct repercussions for consumers.\"</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Complying with environmental rules isn't usually the top priority for Tesla management, people familiar with the company's officials said.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Tesla has continued to draw the attention of regulators. On June 4, 2024, Austin Water regulators notified Tesla that it had violated its permit with the city when it discharged to the sewer system more than 9,000 gallons of wastewater that wasn't properly treated for pH, according to documents released under public-records requests. On Aug. 30, 2024, TCEQ notified Tesla of five violations, including exceeding its permitted emissions limit for certain air pollutants and not disclosing deviations, according to the documents.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The year before, Tesla sold nearly 500,000 vehicles, and sales were growing rapidly. But Musk had moonshot ambitions for the company to grow sales by more than 50% each year to eventually hit his goal to sell 20 million cars in 2030. Giga Texas was a vital part of the plan and to get there, Tesla set a goal to manufacture 5,000 Model Ys a week at the factory.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >For months, the door yawned open as car production churned up. Such a defect would typically cause the furnace to use more fuel and to emit higher levels of pollutants from its smokestack, according to former employees. A constant haze enveloped the factory floor and temperatures reached 100 degrees, they said.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >When a TCEQ regulator arrived for a site visit in early fall 2022, Tesla employees employed an \"elaborate ruse\" to hide the issues, adjusting the amount of fuel going into the furnace and temporarily closing the door, the memo sent to the EPA alleged. These actions allowed Tesla to pass the important emissions test, according to the memo.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The staffer's memo said managers were aware the regulator's tests didn't represent \"actual operating conditions,\" but the gambit worked, and the factory received a passing grade. Afterward, the fuel levels were put back to their regular settings, the memo said. Former employees say the furnace door wasn't permanently fixed for several more months.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In August 2024, TCEQ issued notices of violation to the company related to fuel use. By the time the regulator issued the notices, Tesla had already largely resolved the problems, according to TCEQ documents.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >TCEQ disclosed through a public information request from the Journal that there were 15 investigations of the Tesla Austin facility -- 14 related to air and one to waste.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >With production ramping up at the Gigafactory in the spring of 2022, Tesla decided to celebrate the new facility with a party. It dubbed the event the \"Cyber Rodeo.\"</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Workers got ready by rolling in mechanical bulls and buffing the factory floors to a shine for 15,000 guests, including investors and VIPs like Harrison Ford, who were set to tour the facility.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But behind the scenes, some at Tesla were fretting about a roughly six-acre, triangular-shaped \"evaporation\" pond Tesla built to hold wastewater from construction, chemical spills and its paint shop.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The pond was filled with toxins, including sulfuric and nitric acids, and the algae-colored water had begun to smell of rotten eggs, former employees said. At one point, employees found a dead deer in the water, they said. For a time, Tesla discharged untreated pond water directly into the sewer system without permission from Austin Water, the water utility for the city, according to former employees and emails from regulators.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >By the time of the party, Tesla had self-reported its actions to Austin Water. To hide the eyesore, it hired a team of contractors to pump most of the pond's water into trucks across the road, after having secured permission to then divert the water from the trucks into the sewer system.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Austin Water said in a statement that it later issued a notice of violation in connection with the pond to Tesla through email and required the company to meet monthly to \"avoid further violations,\" and that it works to develop a \"working partnership with our industrial customers\" to protect the city's wastewater treatment facilities.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Sometimes during rainstorms, Tesla discharged a sludgy mix of mud and chemicals from occasional spills outside the plant, turning a 3/4 mile stretch of the Colorado River into a mucky brown slick, according to pictures and videos viewed by the Journal.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A top civil engineer at Tesla \"repeatedly committed to fixing the storm sewer system\" in 2022 but \"never directed any serious repairs,\" a former staffer wrote in the memo to the EPA outlining the issue. Instead, Tesla periodically cleaned the storm sewer with pressurized water and vacuum trucks, according to the memo reviewed by the Journal.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Even when it wasn't raining, the Gigafactory generated vast amounts of industrial wastewater as it built cars -- about 500,000 gallons a day, currently according to the water utility -- and like most companies it was required to obey certain rules in disposing of it.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The company had assured regulators multiple times that its system was working, according to state regulators and emails reviewed by the Journal. But the system wasn't completely separating out pollutants, according to former employees and an April 2022 email reviewed by the Journal.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >As a partial stopgap, the company assigned a staffer to manually test the wastewater, according to the memo sent to the EPA and former employees. But despite their efforts, the levels exceeded what Tesla's permit allowed, and between Sept. 9-11, the company released 259,000 gallons of caustic water into the Austin sewer system, according to emails from state regulators to Tesla that were reviewed by the Journal.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In a statement, Austin Water said the release didn't pose a threat to fish or other aquatic life, and that Tesla \"did not receive a permit to discharge process water until all pretreatment systems were installed and operational.\"</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On Sept. 20, Austin Water issued two notices of violations to Tesla for exceeding the pH limit in its permit, according to state regulators and emails to Tesla provided by the city of Austin under a public information request.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Problems mounted a few days later when an outside lab that Tesla hired to test its wastewater notified environmental staff that the company had exceeded its permit level for zinc, according to the memo and former employees.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Environmental staff notified Austin Water, but one member refused to comply with a request from Tesla managers to lobby the regulator not to consider the violation as a \"significant non-compliance,\" according to the memo.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Donald Trump's second presidential term could have huge implications for U.S. trade policy, climate change, the war in Ukraine, electric vehicles, Americans' taxes and illegal immigration.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump on Monday pledged to impose tariffs on the United States' top three trading partners including a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >While some of his campaign proposals would require congressional approval, here is a summary of the policies he has said he will pursue when he takes office on Jan. 20:</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >MORE TARIFFS</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In his first major tariff pledge since the election, Trump pledged an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, and said he would issue executive orders on his first day in office to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% tariff on all imports from the two U.S. neighbors. Critics say tariffs could lead to higher prices for American consumers and global economic instability.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >New tariffs would appear to violate the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade, which Trump signed into law during his first term in office and took effect in 2020.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He has also said he should have the authority to set higher tariffs on countries that have put tariffs on U.S. imports. He has threatened to impose a 200% tariff on some imported cars, saying he is determined in particular to keep cars from Mexico from coming into the country.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But he has also suggested that allies such as the European Union could see higher duties on their goods. Trump has targeted China in particular. He proposes phasing out Chinese imports of goods such as electronics, steel and pharmaceuticals over four years. He seeks to prohibit Chinese companies from owning U.S. real estate and infrastructure in the energy and tech sectors.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has said \"tariff\" is his favorite word and views them as revenue generators that would help fill government coffers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >MASS DEPORTATIONS</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has vowed to reinstate his first-term policies targeting illegal border crossings and to forge ahead with sweeping new restrictions.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He has pledged to limit access to asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border and to embark on the biggest deportation effort in American history, which would likely trigger legal challenges and opposition from Democrats in Congress.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He has said he will employ the National Guard, and, if necessary, federal troops, to achieve his objective, and he has not ruled out setting up internment camps to process people for deportation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has said he would seek to end automatic citizenship for children born to immigrants, a move that would run against the long-running interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He has also suggested he would revoke protected legal status for some populations such as Haitians or Venezuelans.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump says he will reinstitute the so-called \"travel ban\" that restricts entry into the United States of people from a list of largely Muslim-dominant countries, which sparked multiple legal battles during his first term. Some of Trump's earliest appointments reflected an urgency to follow through on his immigration agenda. Trump has named a \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, and will make Stephen Miller, the architect of his immigration plans, a White House deputy chief of staff.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >DRILLING AWAY</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has vowed to increase U.S. production of fossil fuels by easing the permitting process for drilling on federal land and would encourage new natural gas pipelines. He has said he would reauthorize oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Trump has pledged to create a National Energy Council to coordinate policies to boost U.S. energy production that will be led by his pick for interior secretary, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Whether the oil industry follows through and raises production at a time when oil and gas prices are relatively low remains to be seen.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has said he will again pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accords, a framework for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, and would support increased nuclear energy production. He would also roll back Democratic President Joe Biden's electric-vehicle mandates and other policies aimed at reducing auto emissions.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He has argued that the U.S. needs to be able to boost energy production to be competitive in developing artificial intelligence systems, which consume large amounts of power.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >TAX RELIEF Along with his trade and energy agendas, Trump has promised to slash federal regulations that he says limit job creation. He has pledged to keep in place a broad 2017 tax cut that he signed while in office, and his economic team has discussed a further round of individual and corporate tax cuts beyond those enacted in his first term.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has pledged to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% from 21% for companies that make their products in the U.S.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He has said he would seek legislation to end the taxation of tips and overtime wages to aid waiters and other service workers. He has pledged not to tax or cut Social Security benefits.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has also said that as president he would pressure the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates - but would stop short of demanding it.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Most, if not all, of his tax proposals would require congressional action. Budget analysts have warned that the bevy of tax cuts would balloon the federal debt.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >DOING AWAY WITH DIVERSITY PROGRAMS</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has pledged to require U.S. colleges and universities to \"defend American tradition and Western civilization\" and to purge them of diversity programs. He said he would direct the Justice Department to pursue civil rights cases against schools that engage in racial discrimination.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At K-12 schools, Trump would support programs allowing parents to use public funds for private or religious instruction.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump also wants to abolish the federal Department of Education, and leave states in control of schooling.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >NO FEDERAL ABORTION BAN</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump appointed three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who were part of the majority that did away with Roe v. Wade's constitutional protection for abortion. He likely would continue to appoint federal judges who would uphold abortion limits.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >At the same time, he has said a federal abortion ban is unnecessary and that the issue should be resolved at the state level. He has argued that a six-week ban favored by some Republicans is overly harsh and that any legislation should include exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has suggested he would not seek to limit access to the abortion drug mifepristone after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the government's approach to regulating it.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He supports policies that advance in vitro fertilization (IVF), birth control and prenatal care.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A PUSH TO END WARS Trump has been critical of U.S. support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, and has said he could end the war in 24 hours if elected - although he has not said how he would achieve this.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He has suggested Ukraine may have to yield some of its territory if a peace deal is to be struck, an idea Ukraine has consistently rejected. Trump's pick for his national security adviser, U.S. Representative Michael Waltz, was critical of the Biden administration's decision in November to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided missiles to strike within Russian territory.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has also said that under his presidency the U.S. would fundamentally rethink \"NATO's purpose and NATO's mission.\"</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump named U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a China hawk, as his secretary of state, charged with carrying out his foreign policy goals. Trump has backed Israel in its fight against Hamas in Gaza but has urged it to wrap up its offensive. He can be expected to continue the Biden administration's policy of arming Israel. At the same time, Trump is likely to push for historic normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, an effort he made during his 2017-2021 presidency and which Biden has also pursued.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has said if he becomes president, he will \"stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon,\" but has not said how he will achieve that.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >He has suggested building an \"iron dome\" - a massive missile-defense shield similar to Israel's - over the entire continental United States.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has also floated sending armed forces into Mexico to battle drug cartels and using the U.S. Navy to form a blockade of that country to stop the smuggling of fentanyl and its precursors. His transition team has been drawing up lists of potential high-ranking U.S. military officers to fire as part of a purge of the Pentagon of those believed to be \"disloyal\" to Trump.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >INVESTIGATING ENEMIES, AIDING ALLIES Trump has pledged at times to use federal law enforcement agencies to investigate his political foes, including election officials, lawyers and party donors.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his U.S. attorney general. Bondi has said those who brought criminal charges against Trump should have trials of their own, telling Fox News in 2023 that \"the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones.\"</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Along that line, Trump has said he will consider appointing a special prosecutor to probe Biden, though he has not specified the grounds for such an investigation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And he has said he would consider firing a U.S. attorney who did not follow his directives - which would constitute a break with the longstanding U.S. policy of an independent federal law enforcement apparatus.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has said he will consider pardoning all of those who have been convicted of crimes in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In addition to criminal investigations, he has suggested using the government's regulatory powers to punish those he views as critics, such as television networks.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >PURGING THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump would seek to decimate what he terms the \"deep state\" – career federal employees he says are clandestinely pursuing their own agendas – through an executive order that would reclassify thousands of workers to enable them to be fired. That would likely be challenged in court. He has said he will set up an independent government efficiency panel headed by billionaire supporter Elon Musk and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to root out waste in the federal government. The government already has watchdogs such as the Office of Management and Budget, and investigators general at federal agencies.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump would crack down on federal whistleblowers, who are typically shielded by law, and would institute an independent body to \"monitor\" U.S. intelligence agencies.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump's election may look like a black dawn to climate activists. And indeed it is: When the timelines of climate action are so short, and the paths to climate stability so narrow and difficult, any setback is a disaster. In 2018, considering a world 1.5 degrees warmer than in preindustrial times, the world's scientists issued an unignorable warning about the consequences; in 2024, according to a Carbon Brief analysis, we have already surpassed 1.5. And now we know, almost surely, that the United States will be leading the world more quickly and belligerently into that danger zone, not helping to chart a way out of it.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But the skeptic's election is also a confirmation of an international turn in the politics of warming as much as it is a sharp or distinctly American break. Yes, a global renewables boom is well underway, with worldwide investment in clean energy reaching $2 trillion this year and total solar capacity doubling since 2022. But the climate logic of that transition increasingly goes unspoken in all but the most committed corners, replaced by chin-scratching about energy politics. Governments have retreated from even their legally binding promises to decarbonize, trusting markets to deliver comparatively meager emissions reductions instead, and activists have been unable to generate meaningful public outrage at the walkback.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Partly this is a sign of some success. When Trump was first elected in 2016, clean energy was something of a niche concern, as Heatmap's Robinson Meyer pointed out last week; now it is ''central to modern economic development and to geopolitics'' almost everywhere, even those places where political debate has moved on.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In Europe, for instance, where politicians terrified of ''greenlash'' have pulled back from their climate push, emissions nevertheless fell by more than 8 percent last year -- nearly as fast as in the year of pandemic lockdowns, though probably not fast enough to meet the most ambitious global targets. Globally, national policy commitments are actually lagging behind market forecasts for renewables, though forecasts aren't destiny: Many of the tech companies that won admiration for their world-leading decarbonization plans have watched their emissions rise instead -- some by as much as 30 percent in four years, thanks to the astronomical energy demands of artificial intelligence.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the United States, the presidential race featured little direct debate over the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic climate investment on which President Biden wagered much of his legislative legacy; in campaigning, his vice president spent more time boasting that the country had set records for oil and gas production. In his first term, Trump got an awful lot of mileage out of denouncing the Paris agreement and the Green New Deal. On the trail this time, he made token references to the ''great scam'' of warming, but he focused his closing argument on fear-mongering about gender surgeries for inmates -- of which, in total under Biden, there have been two in federal prisons.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The president-elect's energy and climate agenda remains murky, like so many of the plans he tossed off on the campaign trail. In the spring at Mar-a-Lago, Trump promised a group of oil and gas executives that for a billion dollars of campaign contributions, he would grant them regulatory rollbacks in return. He has separately promised to claw back unspent funds allocated by the I.R.A., but plenty of fossil fuel companies have lobbied on behalf of the bill and its handouts.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some energy modelers have published research showing expected emissions backsliding from the United States, though others have argued that the I.R.A. is hardly accelerating the country's pace of decarbonization, instead merely piggybacking on historical trajectories proceeding independent of energy policy. Trump is bad news for offshore wind power and regulatory action on methane. Some environmentalists fear even worse setbacks for protections unrelated to climate warming: against lead pollution, and PFAS contamination and the many other hazardous chemicals leaching from fossil-fuel plants and industrial agriculture and into our soils, our waters and our air.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But for all his anti-environmentalist bluster, Trump's most conspicuous aide-de-camp is a clean-tech billionaire, Elon Musk, and the fact that congressional districts that voted for him in 2020 received three-times as much I.R.A. spending as those that went for Biden suggests at least the possibility of a near future more in line with the ''all of the above'' energy policy of Barack Obama and Biden. There will be many new liquefied natural gas export terminals approved, in defiance of the energy modeling of climate science, which has repeatedly shown that even existing fossil-fuel infrastructure is incompatible with the world's climate goals. Coal, at least, is not is not making a comeback, but there may be something of a nuclear revival under Trump. And it's even possible that some efforts at permitting reform could produce green-energy progress alongside the fossil-fuel bonanza such deregulation would unleash.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >On the global stage, Trump's victory looks like an effective surrender in the green tech arms race with China, which not that long ago formed the cornerstone of America's new industrial strategy -- a confused hodgepodge of geopolitical rivalry and domestic economic repair that promised to restore U.S. manufacturing might and secure an imperial share of the world's clean-energy future. In China, emissions may have already peaked -- a miraculous turn of events that has forced American hawks to present Beijing's commitment to clean energy, rather than the opposite, as the larger geopolitical problem.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This, too, may look in retrospect like a simple confirmation of past trends. Over the past five years, as China has bet its economic future on green energy, American business has grown increasingly enamored of artificial intelligence instead -- a pattern that looks set to intensify under the watch of a Trump White House barnacled with Silicon Valley accelerationists whose main energy concern is how to power a whole armada of new data centers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In ''Overshoot,'' a rageful, radical and timely new history of the ecological present, the activist scholars Wim Carton and Andreas Malm ask how it is -- how it could be -- that the world seems to be surrendering to climate breakdown. ''What do we do when catastrophic climate chaos is a fact?'' they ask. The apparent answer is ''Let it continue for the time being.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >They drew the title for their book from the word scientists have applied to the hope that having crossed intimidating warming thresholds, the world could ultimately be pulled back from the brink and the legacy climate gradually restored. For the time being, at least, we're still moving in the wrong direction: ''The warmer the globe became, the more fossil fuels were poured on the fire,'' Malm and Carton wrote. ''The higher the temperatures, the larger the emissions.'' Just a few years ago, the temperature levels enclosing us represented no-go zones. But ''the time had come, it was said, to postpone the lost cause. If the house was on fire, putting that fire out would have to wait.''</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >In the meantime, the signals that once alarmed us have continued to bleat: hundreds of deaths and possibly $250 billion in damages from Hurricane Helene; hundreds more deaths and ''car soup'' in Spain's Valencia region in the aftermath of Europe's deadliest floods of the past half century; wildfires in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, the smoke joining clouds of toxic ash carried from flames in New Jersey to blanket New York City in unbreathable air for the second year in a row. Perhaps some futures are scarier to imagine than they are to live through. But not very long ago, any of these events might have been taken by climate-conscious liberals as forbidding signs of a kind of incipient climate apocalypse. Now it all feels like old news.</p>\n",

That will be possible only if the new administration learns from its past mistakes.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >During his first term, Mr. Trump halted the regulatory attack against the energy sector that began under President Obama by using a combination of executive orders and agency rulings. Many of these were challenged and overruled by liberal judges. The effect was only to stall the regulatory momentum, not reverse it. The domestic coal industry went further into runoff mode on Mr. Trump's watch, and the regulatory onslaught picked up in 2021 where it left off four years earlier.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Trump's initial efforts were ineffective because they were built on transitory executive actions. His strategy failed to root out the climate bureaucracy, which has hijacked energy policy. Most U.S. climate rules and regulations have been implemented via executive agencies and the courts, rather than through legislation.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >With this in mind, among Mr. Trump's top priorities should be to free U.S. energy policy from the artificial constraint of greenhouse-gas emissions caps and re-establish the objectives of reliability, abundance and low cost. To achieve lasting results, he will need to restore the rule of law and take advantage of the Republican majorities in Congress. Here are two actions to get the ball rolling:</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >First, rather than simply exit the Paris Agreement again via executive order, Mr. Trump needs to end the unconstitutional back and forth by submitting the climate treaty to the Senate. That chamber's consent is required of all binding international treaties, including to the Paris Agreement and the United Nations' companion Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A treaty requires two-thirds approval to pass the upper chamber. With a 53-seat GOP majority, the Senate's vote would effectively kill the Paris Agreement, restoring American control over national energy policy and removing much of the justification for aggressive U.S. emissions reductions. There should be no waiting period to exit from the treaty, considering it was passed through extralegal means.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Second, the Trump administration ought to strike the 2009 Endangerment Finding from the books. The ruling, devised by the Environmental Protection Agency, compels the EPA to regulate carbon pollution from greenhouse gases because such emissions \"endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.\" The provision has justified anti-fossil-fuel bias across government agencies, particularly during the Biden years.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Rather than issuing a new counterfinding and duking it out in the courts, the Trump White House should urge Congress to pass legislation that reins in the EPA by reasserting congressional authority over the Clean Air Act. Such a move would be consistent with recent Supreme Court decisions in West Virginia v. EPA (2022) and Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024), both of which found that executive agencies can't implement major policy changes without explicit authorization from Congress. Regulating carbon emissions to set national energy policy is doubtless a question of \"vast economic and political significance\" for lawmakers, not unelected regulators.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >More specifically, Congress should claw back control over the running list of in-scope Clean Air Act air pollutants by stating that trace greenhouse gases—including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide—are naturally occurring and not particulate pollutants to be regulated by the EPA.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >This simple proviso could be included in a filibuster-proof budget-reconciliation bill, given the obvious fiscal effect of ceasing climate-related government spending. Federal subsidies for renewable energy and electric vehicles totaled at least $90 billion between fiscal 2016 and 2022. According to some estimates, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act will lead to more than $1 trillion in clean-energy spending over 10 years, more than three times what the law's supporters claimed.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >These measures would return the political fight over climate change to its rightful place—Congress. The U.S. has never had a real public debate over climate change, despite the implications for the economy, national security and financial markets. Climate advocates need to defend their policies and persuade the public via argument rather than merely dismiss critics as \"deniers.\"</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Exiting the Paris Agreement and nixing the 2009 Endangerment Finding would empower Mr. Trump's administration to shut down the bevy of U.N.-aligned decarbonization efforts by state and local governments and net-zero alliances among banks and financial investors. Each of these contravenes federal law by constraining international trade and interstate commerce, violating antitrust law and discriminating against hydrocarbon producers.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Toppling the climate-change bureaucracy would also collapse the \"sustainable finance\" movement, aka \"environmental, social and governance\" investing, on Wall Street. Without climate change as its lodestar and moral suit of armor, ESG is a ragtag collection of liberal policy desires that will quickly blow away.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Mr. Trump has been given a second chance to right U.S. energy policy. To be successful, he'll have to move past campaign slogans and superficial fixes. With unified Republican control of Washington, there's no excuse for failing to recognize the climate elephant in the room.</p>\n",

The data that went into the latest round of climate model simulations are based on observations that only run through 2014, and so they don’t reflect recent changes such as newer pollution controls, volcanic eruptions or even the effects of Covid. Similarly, the forecasts are stuck with scenarios that were common in the early 2000s. Business (and everything else) has changed sharply since then.</p>\n",

That means more comprehensive and faster data gathering from satellites, in situ measurements and economic statistics, converted by analysts for the climate and weather models.

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Some of the information that goes into climate models currently takes years to produce. For instance, while data on greenhouse gas levels and energy from the sun are available within weeks of observations’ being taken, emissions of industrial and agricultural air pollutants need to be estimated from economic data, and this can take years to collect and process.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Scientists should be able to provide “good enough” estimates of these inputs faster using reasonable assumptions. Just as economic analysts frequently update statistics after an initial announcement, such as a quarterly jobs report, scientists could provide data for industrial emissions of pollutants, the activity of the sun, the impacts of volcanoes and greenhouse gas levels on two or more tracks — an initial estimate using as much data as is available quickly, and a fully revised estimate later once more data is in.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >We think that a goal of analyzing data in under six months is achievable if the data-gathering and climate-modeling labs prioritize it.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump is back. But what does the Republican candidate’s victory mean for environment, social and governance (ESG) issues? Here, I break down what Trump’s return means for each ESG metric, both domestically and internationally. Starting with the E When it comes to the environment, Trump has vowed to increase U.S. production of fossil fuels by easing the permitting process for drilling on federal land and would encourage new natural gas pipelines. He has said he will again pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accords, a framework for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, and would support increased nuclear energy production. He would also roll back Democratic President Joe Biden's electric vehicle mandates and other policies aimed at reducing auto emissions. However, the Republican win is unlikely to dramatically slow the U.S. renewable energy boom. Subsidies for new solar, wind and other clean energy projects would be near-impossible to repeal and many of Trump's allies also benefit from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act through their investments in clean energy technologies, as Reuters previously reported.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Unpacking the S As part of the social ‘S’ in ESG, we’ll take a glance at what may be in store for Americans and people around the world impacted by Trump’s return. First up is diversity. A majority of the two dozen Black Americans who spoke to Reuters said they feared a second Trump term, including a rollback of civil rights after his pledge to end federal diversity and inclusion programs. Trump has pledged to purge U.S. colleges and universities of diversity programs and to \"defend American tradition and Western civilization.\" He said he would direct the Justice Department to pursue civil rights cases against schools that engage in racial discrimination.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >How about women’s rights? The second ‘S’ in ESG we’ll take a look at is what Trump has in store for American women’s rights.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump appointed three justices to the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. Supreme Court</span> who were part of the majority that did away with Roe v. Wade's constitutional protection for abortion. He likely would continue to appoint federal judges who would uphold abortion limits. At the same time, he has said a federal abortion ban is unnecessary and that the issue should be resolved at the state level. He has argued that a ban on abortions beyond the sixth week of pregnancy, favored by some Republicans, is overly harsh and that any legislation should include exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother. Trump has suggested he would not seek to limit access to the abortion drug mifepristone after the <span class=\"companylink\">U.S. Supreme Court</span> rejected a challenge to the government's approach to regulating it. He supports policies that advance in vitro fertilization (IVF), birth control and prenatal care.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >What about human rights? Third on the ‘S’ in ESG triumvirate is human rights, especially during conflicts.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Trump has backed Israel in its fight against <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span> in Gaza but has urged it to wrap up its offensive. Palestinians, locked in war with Israel for more than a year, expressed fear at Trump's return to the White House, while the leaders of the militant group <span class=\"companylink\">Hamas</span> and the <span class=\"companylink\">Palestinian Authority</span> urged him to act for peace. He said if he became president, he would \"stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon,\" but has not said how he might achieve that.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >And finally, the G Donald Trump will likely dial back some of the antitrust policies pursued under the Biden administration, potentially including a bid to break up <span class=\"companylink\">Alphabet</span>’s <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span> over its dominance in online search, experts said. Trump is expected to continue cases against Big Tech, several of which began in his first term, but his recent skepticism about a potential <span class=\"companylink\">Google</span> breakup highlights the power he will hold over how those cases are run. The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice would likely scrap merger review guidelines crafted under Biden, said Jon Dubrow, a partner at law firm <span class=\"companylink\">McDermott Will & Emery</span>.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Lucy Yu, CEO of the Centre for Net Zero, an international non-profit organization, spoke to me about her thoughts on the U.S. election outcome and what it means for the clean energy space: \"In his previous term, Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and I assume that’s on the cards and will happen again for a second time. “That would be a real shame for climate targets globally as we need the United States to be in a strong leadership position. “When we look at the adoption, installation and deployment of renewables globally, it's an upward trajectory – whilst costs are falling downwards. We should expect those things to continue. “We shouldn’t assume that progress will grind to a halt. There’s a huge amount of dedicated, good work globally and that will continue. “More people understand the devastating impact of climate change and what it's going to take to address that. In some ways there is still a lot of societal momentum for change. \"Although the President-elect has railed against elements of Biden's flagship climate law, The Inflation Reduction Act, it's unlikely we'll see the policy fully repealed, as it is currently bringing significant investment and employment opportunities to the red states that have put him in power.\"</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >A Biden-era law providing a decade of lucrative subsidies for new solar, wind and other clean-energy projects would be near-impossible to repeal, however, thanks to support from Republican states, while other levers available to the next president would only have marginal impact, analysts say.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are the fastest-growing segments on the power grid, according to the Department of Energy, driven by federal tax credits, state renewable-energy mandates, and technology advancements that have lowered their costs.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >President Joe Biden in 2022 signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act guaranteeing billions of dollars of solar and wind subsidies for another decade as part of his broader effort to decarbonize the power sector by 2035 to fight climate change.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >Before the election, Trump slammed the IRA as being too expensive and promised to rescind all unspent funds allocated by the law - a threat that, if accomplished, could pour cold water over the U.S. clean energy boom.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >But dismantling the IRA would require lawmakers, including those whose states have benefited from IRA-related investments such as solar-panel factories, wind farms and other projects, to vote to repeal it.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"The jobs and the economic benefits have been so heavy in red states, it's hard to see an administration come in that says, 'we don't like this,'\" said Carl Fleming, a partner at law firm <span class=\"companylink\">McDermott Will & Emery</span>, who advised the Biden White House on renewable energy policy.</p>\n",

        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >The production boom started under former President Barack Obama and has continued through the Trump and Biden presidencies. Even so, Trump's campaign has sought to claim credit, saying his efforts to slash regulatory red tape during his 2017-2021 term paved the way, and arguing he could further expand U.S. fossil-fuel production in a second term by rolling back Biden's climate initiatives.</p>\n",
        "<p class=\"articleParagraph enarticleParagraph\" >\"Presidents can make a lot of noise about plans for U.S. oil and gas, but ultimately it's individuals and companies responding to prices of a global commodity that make the decisions on when to drill,\" said Jesse Jones, head of North American upstream at <span class=\"companylink\">Energy Aspects</span>.</p>\n",
