Impacts of the 2024 Election on Sustainability and ESG Discourse
================================================================
Abstract:
----------------------------------------------------------------
Over the past decade, frameworks for evaluating a company's operations, impact and ethical performance beyond traditional financial metrics have become more prominent. Particularly as climate change mitigation  has become a priority for some consumers, investors and nations, more emphasis has been placed not only on the short term financial returns of a businness but also the long run sustainability of industries and society more broadly. This project analyzes discourse around sustainability and ESG topics in the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election and immediately following the election to assess if and how the results of this election impacted the manner in which media houses are approaching these topics. Utilizing news articles from 3 sources I compare and contrast the text data for the time period prior to the election and after using sentiment analysis of headlines, similar words analysis and word clouds to assess the shift in discourse after the national electoral vote.
